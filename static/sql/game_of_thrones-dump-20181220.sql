Lacking the maturity of both his predecessors, he tended towards petulance and sullenesss, usually disagreeing with his small council desired quick action over careful decisiveness. Lacking in his great-grandfather\'s wisdom or his father\'s generosity, Aegon didn\'t even want to be king at the start, and only truly persisted in this regard when Criston Cole pointed out that Rhaenyra would exchange Aegon\'s loyalty by beheading him, his wife and children.\n</p>\n<p>Aegon\'s cruelty was best expressed towards the end of his life: at the climax of the Dance of the Dragons, after Aegon took Dragonstone and lured Rhaenyra into a trap, he proceeded to take her prisoner and persuade his dragon Sunfyre to burn her and then eat her alive <i>in front of her son</i>. Aegon also added a biting insult to this execution, stating that Rhaenyra\'s remaining supporters would find her if they searched the seven hells.\n</p>\n<p>The actions of Aegon II Targaryen left deep scars in Westeros, some of which haven\'t even healed yet. Aegon traumatised his nephew and successor into brooding, decimated cities and populations, damaged the reputation of his supporters and opponents both, and left himself with a terrible reputation after his death. Aegon is not remembered well at all, considered selfish and grasping, even a pawn in the game of his mother and uncle Alicent and Otto Hightower. His actions were fruitless, as Rhaenyra\'s descendants prevailed over his either way and his own line died with his daughter.\n</p>\n<p>Aegon II was the eldest son of King <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Viserys_I_Targaryen\" title=\"Viserys I Targaryen\">Viserys I Targaryen</a>, but not the eldest child. His half-sister <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Rhaenyra_Targaryen\" title=\"Rhaenyra Targaryen\">Rhaenyra</a>, born to Viserys\' first wife, was ten years senior to him. It was expected that Rhaenyra would succeed Viserys to become the first ruling Queen of Westeros, but by the laws of <a class=\"new\" href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Primogeniture?action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Primogeniture (page does not exist)\">male primogeniture</a>, then practised everywhere in Westeros but <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Dorne\" title=\"Dorne\">Dorne</a>, the crown should have instead passed to Aegon. His Dragon, <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Sunfyre\" title=\"Sunfyre\">Sunfyre</a>, was considered the most beautiful dragon that ever flew in Westeros, but the dragon received serious injuries during the war.\n</p>\n<p>When Viserys I died, Ser <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Criston_Cole\" title=\"Criston Cole\">Criston Cole</a> of the <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Kingsguard\" title=\"Kingsguard\">Kingsguard</a> took the crown of <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Aegon_the_Conqueror\" title=\"Aegon the Conqueror\">Aegon the Conqueror</a> and placed it on Aegon\'s head, naming him Aegon II, King of Westeros and Lord of the Seven Kingdoms. Rhaenyra, outraged and furious, claimed the throne herself, taking her father\'s crown and declaring herself Queen.\n</p>\n<p>Aegon II\'s reign was spent fighting the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Dance_of_Dragons\" title=\"Dance of Dragons\">Dance of Dragons</a>, the bitter civil war between himself and Rhaenyra for the Iron Throne. This was a war fought with armies and with <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Dragons\" title=\"Dragons\">dragons</a>, with the Seven Kingdoms divided down the middle between the two claimants.\n</p>\n<p>His faction, known as the Greens, ruled King\'s Landing and had the support of Houses <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/House_Hightower\" title=\"House Hightower\">Hightower</a>, <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/House_Lannister\" title=\"House Lannister\">Lannister</a>, <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/House_Lefford\" title=\"House Lefford\">Lefford</a>, <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/House_Peake\" title=\"House Peake\">Peake</a>, <a class=\"new\" href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/House_Roxton?action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"House Roxton (page does not exist)\">Roxton</a>, <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/House_Reyne\" title=\"House Reyne\">Reyne</a>, <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/House_Swyft\" title=\"House Swyft\">Swyft</a>, <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/House_Crakehall\" title=\"House Crakehall\">Crakehall</a>, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Baratheon\" title=\"Baratheon\">Baratheon</a>, <a class=\"new\" href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/House_Fossoway?action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"House Fossoway (page does not exist)\">Fossoway</a>, <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/House_Redwyne\" title=\"House Redwyne\">Redwyne</a> and <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/House_Strong\" title=\"House Strong\">Strong</a>.\n</p>\n<p>Early in the war, Aegon\'s heir Prince Jaehaerys was murdered in the Red Keep by Blood and Cheese, agents of Prince Daemon\'s go-between. His sister-wife Helaena quickly began to sink into depression and madness.\n</p>\n<p>Because of his grandfather\'s delays in waging war, Aegon stripped Ser Otto of the Handship and awarded it to Criston the Kingmaker. Ser Criston immediately took to the offensive. Aegon himself took the field in a trap set by Cole at Rook\'s Rest, where he and his brother Aemond One-Eye fought and killed Rhaenys Targaryen, the Queen Who Never Was. Aegon and his dragon Sunfyre were badly maimed, he suffering burns and broken bones. It took him a full year to recover, while his younger brother Aemond ruled in his stead.\n</p>\n<p>When his half sister Rhaenyra took King\'s Landing and the Iron Throne in 130AC Larys Strong secreted him away. Disguised as one of the dragonseed smallfolk, Aegon hid on Dragonstone and convinced several blacks to defect and help him take the island. During the coup, he fought Baela Targaryen, both mounted on dragons. He shattered his legs in a fall during the fight. He carried great pain with him for the rest of his life, but refused milk of the poppy because of his experience with it during the recovery from Rook\'s Rest. Meanwhile, his wife Queen Helaena had ended her grief by suicide in the capital. In 130AC, Rhaenyra chose to flee to Dragonstone where she was captured, judged a traitor, and eaten by Aegon\'s dragon Sunfyre as he and Aegon III watched.\n</p>\n<p>Despite his victory, Aegon II did not live long to enjoy it. He was poisoned by his own men after only six months and was succeeded by Rhaenyra\'s eldest son, who was named <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Aegon_III_Targaryen\" title=\"Aegon III Targaryen\">Aegon III Targaryen</a>. Aegon II had children of his own, but his eldest son Jaehaerys, was murdered at the beginning of the war, and his younger son Maelor was ripped to pieces by a mob at Bitterbridge, so his only daughter Jaehaera married her cousin Aegon to end the feud between the branches, and Jaehaera herself dying a few years later, ending Aegon\'s lineage.\n</p>','http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Aegon_II_Targaryen',NULL,153,NULL),(9,'Aegon III Targaryen',1,0,NULL,'<p>King <b>Aegon III Targaryen</b>, also known as <b>Aegon the Dragonbane</b>, was the seventh king of the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Targaryen\" title=\"Targaryen\">Targaryen</a> dynasty to sit on the <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Iron_Throne\" title=\"Iron Throne\">Iron Throne</a> of <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Westeros\" title=\"Westeros\">Westeros</a>.\n</p>\n<p>Aegon was the fourth son of <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Rhaenyra_Targaryen\" title=\"Rhaenyra Targaryen\">Rhaenyra Targaryen</a> and the grandson of King <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Viserys_I\" title=\"Viserys I\">Viserys I</a>.

The resulting dynastic civil war became known as the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Dance_of_Dragons\" title=\"Dance of Dragons\">Dance of Dragons</a>. Aegon was scarred during this war by witnessing his mother being swallowed whole by his uncle\'s <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Dragons\" title=\"Dragons\">dragon</a>, and developed a fierce hatred and terror of the creatures afterwards.\n</p>\n<p>Aegon II died not long after Rhaenyra, and Aegon inherited the throne as Aegon III. Since Aegon II\'s two sons and two brothers died during the war, he married his cousin Jaehaera to reconcile both factions.\n</p>\n<p>Aegon III\'s reign was relatively free of incident, and was mainly concerned with mending the rift in the kingdom caused by the civil war.\n</p>\n<p>Because he was crowned when he was only eleven, several regents from both former factions competed against each other to gain influence, until Aegon came of age when he was sixteen. Thanks to the rather drastic, but decisive actions of Lord <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Cregan_Stark\" title=\"Cregan Stark\">Cregan Stark</a>, his court was swiftly cleaned from the most harmful influences.\n</p>\n<p>He married his cousin Jaehaera, to bring together both lineages, but the marriage was childless. His second wife, Daenaera Velaryon, on the other hand gave him 2 sons and 3 daughters. He was a competent if unspectacular ruler. During his rule the last Targaryen dragon, a little sickly green creature, died and her <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Dragon_Eggs\" title=\"Dragon Eggs\">three eggs</a> did not hatch. This, combined with his well-known hatred of dragons, led to Aegon III being called the \'Dragonbane\' by some.\n</p>\n<p>Upon his death in 157 AL, Aegon III was succeeded by his young son <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Daeron_I_Targaryen\" title=\"Daeron I Targaryen\">Daeron</a>, the Young Dragon.\n</p>\n<p>Aegon III was apparently doted on by his mother, and her death in front of him was a shocking event that left an indelible mark on his character. He was sombre for much of his life after this point, rarely smiling, and traditionally dressed in black as a symbol of mourning. Apparently the only time he smiled after the war was when his younger brother <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Viserys_II_Targaryen\" title=\"Viserys II Targaryen\">Viserys</a>, who he had thought dead for years, returned safely from Essos. Not much more is known of his character, although he does seem to have successfully kept the kingdom reunited following the divisions of the civil war.\n</p>\n<p>It is known that Aegon hated the company of others, with almost the singular exception of his brother Viserys. To say that he was not a good king is actually rather debatable, as he proved much better than his predecessor, Aegon the Elder, who didn\'t even want to be king originally. Aegon made pretty solid repairs to damage done during the Dance of the Dragons, and brought some prosperity to the realm. His decision to make Viserys his hand was a stroke of brilliance, as Viserys would serve ably as hand to Aegon himself, and both of his sons, managing the Seven Kingdoms while Aegon brooded, Daeron started a war that made the realm bleed, and Baelor fasted himself into an early grave.\n</p>\n<p>In appearance, Aegon III was pale, lean and unsmiling. He had a short beard but no moustache. He dressed in black throughout his life, down to his gloves, and wore a three-headed dragon on a golden chain around his neck. To avoid division, he did not wear either of the crowns of Rhaenyra or Aegon II, instead preferring a simple, unormented golden band.\n</p>','http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Aegon_III_Targaryen',NULL,153,34),(10,'Aegon IV Targaryen',1,0,NULL,'<p>King <b>Aegon IV Targaryen</b> was the eleventh king of the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Targaryen\" title=\"Targaryen\">Targaryen</a> dynasty to sit on the <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Iron_Throne\" title=\"Iron Throne\">Iron Throne</a> of <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Westeros\" title=\"Westeros\">Westeros</a>.\n</p>\n<p>Aegon IV was the eldest son of the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/King%27s_Hand\" title=\"King\'s Hand\">King\'s Hand</a>, <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Viserys_II_Targaryen\" title=\"Viserys II Targaryen\">Viserys</a> and Larra Rogare, and grew up whilst his cousins <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Daeron_I\" title=\"Daeron I\">Daeron I</a> and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Baelor_I\" title=\"Baelor I\">Baelor I</a> ruled. His mother returned to Lys shortly after Naerys birth, and his father was always busy with his duties as Hand, this lack of supervision helped define Aegon\'s character in adult life. Aegon\'s brother, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Aemon_the_Dragonknight\" title=\"Aemon the Dragonknight\">Aemon</a>, became a great knight and warrior during Daeron\'s invasion of <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Dorne\" title=\"Dorne\">Dorne</a> and was held captive after the war, until he was freed by Baelor\'s negotiations.\n</p>\n<p>Upon becoming king, Baelor dissolved his marriage to his <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Sister-wife\" title=\"Sister-wife\">sister-wife</a> <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Daena_Targaryen\" title=\"Daena Targaryen\">Daena</a> and imprisoned her and her two younger sisters, <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Rhaena_Targaryen\" title=\"Rhaena Targaryen\">Rhaena</a> and <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Elaena_Targaryen\" title=\"Elaena Targaryen\">Elaena</a> in the <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Maidenvault\" title=\"Maidenvault\">Maidenvault</a> so the sight of them would not tempt him to carnal thoughts.

On one occasion he helped Daena escape from the Maidenvault and they conceived a child. Daena refused to say who the father was, and was dubbed \'Daena the Defiant\' for her wilfulness. In time she gave birth to a son, <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Daemon_Blackfyre\" title=\"Daemon Blackfyre\">Daemon</a> and Aegon noted with approval that he was growing up to be a strong warrior.\n</p>\n<p>Baelor starved himself to death and Viserys only ruled for a single year before passing himself, so the throne passed to Aegon, Fourth of His Name.\n</p>\n<p>Aegon IV is generally considered to be one of the worst kings in the history of Westeros, and is dubbed \'Aegon the Unworthy\' in history texts. Although he kept the realm out of war, his personal life was dissolute and shocking even by Targaryen standards, and his actions at the end of his life paved the way for the then-<a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Blackfyre_Rebellion\" title=\"Blackfyre Rebellion\">bloodiest civil war</a> in the history of the nation. \n</p>\n<p>He was a decadent, cruel, selfish, corrupt ruler who indulged his passions and whims at every opportunity, regardless of social or moral obstacles. Over the course of his life he had, quite openly, <i>nine</i> \'<a class=\"new\" href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Great_Mistresses?action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Great Mistresses (page does not exist)\">Great Mistresses</a>\', and flaunted them at court. These nine women, out of apparently nine hundred, were the women that Aegon proclaimed himself to have loved. Daena was not counted in this number, and their tryst was not openly admitted until long after he became king. Of the nine mistresses, several bore him bastard sons and daughters.\n</p>\n<p>This was to the distress of his sister-wife Naerys, who was frequently miserable and, according to some, sought comfort in the arms of her other brother, Prince Aemon the Dragonknight. Aegon IV and Naerys did bear two legitimate children, <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Daeron_II_Targaryen\" title=\"Daeron II Targaryen\">Daeron II</a> early in their marriage and <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Daenerys_Martell\" title=\"Daenerys Martell\">Daenerys</a> later on. However, while Naerys found peace and kindness in her brother and son, she never found it in Aegon, who was crueller to her than he was to anyone else. He continued to bed her even after he was told that doing so might kill her due to her frailty. Even after she died, he refused to honour her memory. It is likely that he only kept her around out of cruelty, as he could have allowed her to become a septa instead of a queen.\n</p>\n<p>Aegon IV\'s cruelty and capriciousness was revealed when he caught one of his <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Kingsguard\" title=\"Kingsguard\">Kingsguard</a>, Ser <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Terrence_Toyne\" title=\"Terrence Toyne\">Terrence Toyne</a>, abed with one of his mistresses, <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Bethany_Bracken\" title=\"Bethany Bracken\">Bethany Bracken</a> . He had both killed immediately. Two of Toyne\'s brothers attempted to murder Aegon IV in vengeance, but instead killed his brother Aemon. Aegon IV had the house destroyed and its members outcast, but they would go on to trouble the realm for several generations until Ser <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Arthur_Dayne\" title=\"Arthur Dayne\">Barristan Selmy</a> put an end to their last descendant, <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Simon_Toyne\" title=\"Simon Toyne\">Simon Toyne</a>, almost a century later. Despite this, descendants of Terrence\'s affair with Bethany survived to the late third century.\n</p>\n<p>As Aegon IV\'s children grew up, he became disinclined to pass the throne to his son Daeron, whom he had wed to Princess <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Myriah_Martell\" title=\"Myriah Martell\">Myriah Martell</a> to shore up relationships with Dorne but had come to show signs of weakness, preferring the company of <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Septon\" title=\"Septon\">septons</a> and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Maesters\" title=\"Maesters\">maesters</a> to warriors. Aegon IV\'s eldest natural-born son, Daemon, had instead grown up to be strong and charismatic, a true warrior without compare. On Daemon\'s twelfth birthday, Aegon IV openly acknowledged him as his natural-born son and presented him with the <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Valyrian_steel\" title=\"Valyrian steel\">Valyrian steel</a> blade <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Blackfyre_(sword)\" title=\"Blackfyre (sword)\">Blackfyre</a> as a gift, shocking the Seven Kingdoms for Blackfyre, the blade of <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Aegon_the_Conqueror\" title=\"Aegon the Conqueror\">Aegon the Conqueror</a>, was arguably the greatest and strongest symbol of Targaryen rule.\n</p>\n<p>He was obsessed with the restoration of dragons, much like other Targaryens who preceded and succeeded him. However, indulging grand schemes to conquer Dorne, Aegon commanded that dragons be built; iron and wood monstrosities were built that could shoot jets of flame. However, when Aegon planned on initiating this second Conquest of Dorne, the plan not only suffered from complete impracticality, but from the fact that these \'dragons\' exploded in the Kingswood, incinerating hundreds along with a quarter of the Kingswood. Aegon refused to speak of Dorne ever again. This would be the most ludicrous attempt by a Targaryen to bring back the dragons until his great-grandson Prince Aerion Brightflame consumed wildfire under the impression that it would transform him into one. \n</p>\n<p>In his later life, Aegon IV seemed to often praise the accomplishments of Daemon and his other warrior bastard son, <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Aegor_Rivers\" title=\"Aegor Rivers\">Aegor Rivers</a>, but held silent on his heir Daeron\'s achievements. Some whispered that Aegon had heard the rumours that Daeron was actually the son of Naerys and Aemon, and was planning to formally disinherit Daeron in favour of Daemon.\n</p>\n<p>In the event this did not happen. Aegon IV had become immensely fat in later life and fell ill without warning. He died quickly, but before he did so he legitimised his four <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Great_Bastards\" title=\"Great Bastards\">Great Bastards</a>, as they were known, on his deathbed.\n</p>\n<p>Despite the rumours, Daeron took the throne, styling himself King Daeron II Targaryen and his half-brother Daemon, now calling himself Daemon Blackfyre, held his peace for a time.\n</p>\n<p>In early life Aegon IV was a strong, fit young man and a capable warrior, if completely outshone by his brother Aemon\'s martial abilities. In later life Aegon became immensely fat, and grew a beard to hide his round cheeks and multiple chins (this failed). His eyes became lost in the folds of his face and his legs had difficulty supporting his bulk. In the last few years of his life he took to wearing immense amounts of jewellery, such as rings and chains, and had a new crown forged, a substantial device surmounted by four dragons.\n</p>\n<p>As a younger man Aegon IV could be charming and was known for his robustness and vigour. He liked to surround himself with pretty girls and powerful women, and his sexual appetites in regards to them were boundless. As he grew older, he became much angrier, prone to jealousy and terrifying rages where he was quite capable of killing or ordering people killed. At least two of his mistresses faced bloody ends for associating with him, and one of them was executed for cavorting with a member of his Kingsguard. Some of his mistresses could calm his temper, but the only person capable of fully calming him was his youngest bastard daughter, <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Shiera_Seastar\" title=\"Shiera Seastar\">Shiera</a>, whom he doted on.\n</p>\n<p>Aegon fought constantly with both his sister-wife Queen Naerys and his brother Prince Aemon, the former because despite being his wife she was everything he hated in a woman, and the latter because of their immense differences and the fact that Aemon resented his brother\'s cruelty to Naerys. Neither of them, upon their deaths, were honoured by Aegon, who entertained the rumour that they had been lovers until the end of his reign. He did not get on well with his trueborn heir Daeron, but doted on his illegitimate children, especially Daemon Waters, upon whom he bestowed Blackfyre itself. This would cause controversy between great lords and common men, who argued that either Aegon recognised Daemon as his true heir, or that he simply realised that Daemon was a better warrior than Daeron and more suited for the blade.\n</p>\n<p>The ultimate example of Aegon IV\'s petulant rage was his legitimising of his bastards on his deathbed, which would eventually lead to a devastating loss of life and dynastic chaos that would weaken the Targaryen dynasty.\n</p>\n<p>Aegon was the cruellest king since Maegor, and after his death his only rival would be his great-great-great-great grandson, King Aerys II Targaryen.\n</p>','http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Aegon_IV_Targaryen',NULL,153,NULL),(11,'Aegon Targaryen (son of Gaemon)',1,0,NULL,'<p>Lord <b>Aegon Targaryen</b> was the third Lord of <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Dragonstone\" title=\"Dragonstone\">Dragonstone</a> from <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/House_Targaryen\" title=\"House Targaryen\">House Targaryen</a>.\n</p>\n<p>Aegon was born on dragonstone, as the son of Lord <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Gaemon_Targaryen_(son_of_Aenar)\" title=\"Gaemon Targaryen (son of Aenar)\">Gaemon Targaryen</a> and his sister, <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Daenys_Targaryen\" title=\"Daenys Targaryen\">Daenys</a>.

Prince Aerion partook in the jousting tourney against Ser Humfrey Hardying, one of champions defending Lady Ashford. In the joust Aerion charges his lance upwards to Ser Humfrey\'s warhorse and impales it. The horse dies falling on Ser Humfrey leg, breaking it. Prince Baelor witnessing this, awards Ser Humfrey by giving him Aerion\'s horse and delcaring the injured knight the victor. That night, prince Aerion attacks a puppeteer\'s booth and assaults the puppeteer, Tanselle. Aerion is in fury because of the puppeteer\'s display of a puppet show, showing a dragon dying in battle. Aerion proclaims to her that she is a traitor and tells her that \"the dragon ought to never lose\".

Since a Trial of Seven hadn\'t been invoked in one hundred years, Ser Dunk had to find seven combatants against the word of prince. Prince Aerion has the kingsguard and his father Maekar to fight with, against Ser Dunk and his six combantants. In the joust against Ser Dunk, Aerion tilts Dunk, but is grappled into submission by Ser Dunk. Aerion recants his accusation against Dunk, thus ending the Trial. After the end of tourney, Prince Maekar has son exiled to <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Lys\" title=\"Lys\">Lys</a>, in an effort to appease the masses.

Jon beats the other recruits easily, due to his previous training at <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Winterfell\" title=\"Winterfell\">Winterfell</a>, but is unaware that Thorne, who despises <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Eddard_Stark\" title=\"Eddard Stark\">Eddard Stark</a> for the part he played in Robert\'s Rebellion, is making him unpopular by emphasizing his superiority. <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Tyrion_Lannister\" title=\"Tyrion Lannister\">Tyrion Lannister</a> advises Jon to take into account the less privileged upbringing of the other recruits and suggests that Jon could befriend them by sharing his skills.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-1\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">[2]</a></sup>\n</p>\n<p>Later, Thorne is disgusted by the obesity and softness of new recruit <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Samwell_Tarly\" title=\"Samwell Tarly\">Samwell Tarly</a>, nicknaming him \"Lord Piggy\". He has Rast beat Sam when he will not fight back. Jon convinces the others to refuse to hurt Sam, but when they do, Thorne sees through the ruse and berates Jon. Thorne later confronts Jon and Sam, revealing that he once had to cannibalize the frozen remains of his comrades to avoid starvation during a ranging beyond the Wall in a particularly cold winter. He berates Jon and Sam for their softness, and warns Jon that his \"protection\" of Sam from the harsh training that he needs will eventually get him killed.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-BrokenThings_0-1\"><a href=\"#cite_note-BrokenThings-0\">[1]</a></sup>\n</p>\n<p>Thorne is pleased when Jon is made a steward, since Jon had hoped to become a ranger like his uncle <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Benjen_Stark\" title=\"Benjen Stark\">Benjen Stark</a>. <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Lord_Commander\" title=\"Lord Commander\">Lord Commander</a> <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Jeor_Mormont\" title=\"Jeor Mormont\">Jeor Mormont</a> takes Jon as his personal steward. Jon believes that Thorne played a hand in him becoming a steward as revenge for defying him, but Sam convinces Jon that this means that Jon will be privy to the inner workings of the Night\'s Watch command structure, and that the Lord Commander may actually want to groom Jon for a high position within the Watch.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-2\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">[3]</a></sup>\n</p>\n<p>After Eddard is (falsely) arrested as a traitor, Thorne taunts Jon and calls him \"not only a bastard, but a <i>traitor\'s</i> bastard\". Jon draws a knife and attempts to strike Thorne but is restrained and punished by being restricted to his quarters.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-3\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">[4]</a></sup> Later, the Lord Commander sends Thorne to <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/King%27s_Landing\" title=\"King\'s Landing\">King\'s Landing</a> with the frozen hand of <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Jafer_Flowers\" title=\"Jafer Flowers\">one of the wights</a> to warn King <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Joffrey_Baratheon\" title=\"Joffrey Baratheon\">Joffrey Baratheon</a> and the royal court of the return of the <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/White_Walkers\" title=\"White Walkers\">White Walkers</a>. He notes that part of his decision was to keep Jon and Thorne separated for a time.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-4\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">[5]</a></sup>\n</p>\n<p>Upon his return to the Wall, Thorne has been declared the Acting <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Lord_Commander_of_the_Night%27s_Watch\" title=\"Lord Commander of the Night\'s Watch\">Lord Commander of the Night\'s Watch</a>. He is one of the five black brothers to \"judge\" Jon for his actions during his time with the <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Free_Folk\" title=\"Free Folk\">wildlings</a>. Jon hides nothing of his actions, neither his murder of <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Qhorin\" title=\"Qhorin\">Qhorin</a> nor his affair with <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Ygritte\" title=\"Ygritte\">Ygritte</a>. Thorne disbelieves Jon\'s claim that the Halfhand wanted to die, but Jon counters that if Thorne was as close to Qhorin as he claims, he would know the fallen brother would have done anything to protect the Wall. Maester <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Aemon\" title=\"Aemon\">Aemon</a> defends Jon on the other charge, pointing out that he isn\'t the first to have broken his vow of celibacy. Thorne points out that Jon hasn\'t simply visited the whorehouse in <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Mole%27s_Town\" title=\"Mole\'s Town\">Mole\'s Town</a>: he has quite literally slept with the enemy. Jon counters with all the information that he had learned while among the wildlings, such as <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Mance_Rayder\" title=\"Mance Rayder\">Mance Rayder</a>\'s strategy of attacking the Wall from the North and the South, and demands that they either kill him or let him go. Aemon tells him that they have no intention of executing him and Jon leaves. Thorne reprimands Aemon for having overruled him but Aemon wryly replies that he can tell who is lying to him, since he grew up in <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/King%27s_Landing\" title=\"King\'s Landing\">King\'s Landing</a>.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-5\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">[6]</a></sup>\n</p>\n<p>Thorne is present when a young boy, <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Olly\" title=\"Olly\">Olly</a>, tells the Night\'s Watch how a wildling raiding party massacred his village. Most black brothers want to seek revenge and send the wildlings a message, but Jon and Thorne know better: that is exactly what the wildlings want, to draw them out of Castle Black and fight them in the open. The black brothers are interrupted by two rangers returning, Grenn and Eddison Tollett, who have escaped the mutineers holed up at Craster\'s Keep. Upon learning that the mutineers are still at Craster\'s Keep, Jon claims that they must be captured or killed. Thorne initially refuses, but Jon claims that it is to stop the mutineers from revealing the truth of the Night\'s Watch\'s defenses to Mance Rayder\'s army if they are attacked, since Jon has previously exaggerated to Mance. Thorne has also given Sam a new derogatory nickname: \"Sam the Slayer\", disbelieving his claim that he killed a White Walker with a dragonglass dagger.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-E33_6-0\"><a href=\"#cite_note-E33-6\">[7]</a></sup>\n</p>\n<p>Thorne later berates Jon when he sees him helping Grenn train recruits because he is a steward, and not a ranger. Janos Slynt warns Thorne that since Jon is popular amongst the Night\'s Watch, this will give him an edge over him when a new Lord Commander is elected. Slynt suggests sanctioning Jon\'s expedition to Craster\'s Keep so the mutineers may kill Jon, although Thorne merely walks off after Slynt\'s suggestion. Later on, Thorne sanctions Jon\'s mission to Craster\'s Keep, but tells him that he can only take volunteers with him. However, after an impassioned speech by Jon, a number of black brothers volunteer to go and deal with the mutineers.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-7\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">[8]</a></sup>\n</p>\n<p>Jon survives the <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Raid_on_Craster%27s_Keep\" title=\"Raid on Craster\'s Keep\">mission</a> and returns to Castle Black unharmed, to Thorne and Slynt\'s disappointment. When Thorne catches sight of Jon\'s direwolf, Ghost, he orders Jon to lock up his \'wild beast\' or Ghost will become food for the Watch. Later at the meeting, Jon warns the Night\'s Watch about the impending attack of Mance\'s army and suggests the tunnel to be sealed to prevent giants from bringing it down and exposing the wall. However, Thorne rubbishes the claim and asks the <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/First_Builder\" title=\"First Builder\">First Builder</a>, <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Othell_Yarwyck\" title=\"Othell Yarwyck\">Othell Yarwyck</a>, for his opinion. Yarwyck agrees with Thorne, though he has obviously been intimidated by Thorne\'s tone of voice. He also sends Jon and Sam to keep a watch in the night to look out for Mance\'s army.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-8\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">[9]</a></sup>\n</p>\n<p>When the wildling army arrives, Thorne watches from atop the Wall with Jon, noting \"the biggest fire the North has ever seen\" and the presence of <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Giants\" title=\"Giants\">giants</a> and <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Mammoths\" title=\"Mammoths\">mammoths</a>. He ruefully admits they should have sealed the tunnel as Jon advised. In a moment of compassion, Thorne goes on to explain the pressures and responsibilities of leadership to Jon, but promises him that if they fight as hard as they can, they will survive the night.\n</p>\n<p>After ordering the first volley of arrow attacks against the main wildling army, Thorne is called to bring reinforcements below to Castle Black, where the smaller wildling force south of the Wall is attacking the lightly-defended fortress. Thorne leaves command atop the Wall to the inexperienced Slynt (who is promptly tricked into going below as well, leaving command on the Wall to Jon) and returns to the castle. As the wildlings begin to breach Castle Black\'s walls, Thorne gives an inspiring speech, promising that Castle Black and the Night\'s Watch will still stand at daybreak, and rallies his men, personally leading the counter-charge. Thorne manages to kill several wildlings before he confronts Tormund Giantsbane on the catwalks. They duel evenly for a time, but Tormund finally manages to wound Thorne, who escapes by rolling off the catwalk and falling onto a hay-bale below. The wounded Thorne is then carried to safety by two members of the Night\'s Watch, while screaming at the remaining men fighting to hold the gate at any cost.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-9\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\">[10]</a></sup>\n</p>\n<p>Alliser Thorne has recovered from the wounds he sustained during the <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Battle_of_Castle_Black\" title=\"Battle of Castle Black\">Battle of Castle Black</a> and continues to observe the new recruits. As Thorne walks through the courtyard, he gives <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Gilly\" title=\"Gilly\">Gilly</a> a look of contempt due to his hatred of the wildlings. Later, Thorne is present when <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Mance_Rayder\" title=\"Mance Rayder\">Mance Rayder</a> is executed by <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Stannis_Baratheon\" title=\"Stannis Baratheon\">Stannis Baratheon</a> for refusing to bend the knee.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-10\"><a href=\"#cite_note-10\">[11]</a></sup>\n</p>\n<p>With the choosing of a new official Lord Commander impending, Alliser seems to be the favorite to succeed Jeor Mormont due to his efforts during the Battle at Castle Black. Stannis Baratheon and Davos Seaworth attempt to use this to sway Jon to their side, implying that Alliser will make Jon\'s life in the Watch miserable solely to undermine him. During the choosing, Alliser runs against <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Denys_Mallister\" title=\"Denys Mallister\">Denys Mallister</a> and Jon. While Thorne acknowledges Jon\'s accomplishments, he also reminds the black brothers of Jon\'s sympathy towards the wildlings. However, Thorne loses by a single vote - that of Maester Aemon - and Jon is chosen as the new Lord Commander.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-11\"><a href=\"#cite_note-11\">[12]</a></sup>\n</p>\n<p>Stannis later advises Jon to send Alliser away to <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Eastwatch-by-the-Sea\" title=\"Eastwatch-by-the-Sea\">Eastwatch-by-the-Sea</a>, but Jon prefers to keep him around in order to learn if he is plotting against him. At a meeting, Jon prepares to assign a black brother to oversee the digging of a new latrine pit. Alliser believes that Jon will use this as an opportunity to humiliate him, but is surprised and somewhat elated when Jon acknowledges his skills and names him <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/First_Ranger\" title=\"First Ranger\">First Ranger</a>. When Janos Slynt subsequently defies Jon\'s order of reassignment to Greyguard tower, Ser Alliser initially blocks the black brothers coming to seize Janos, but ultimately steps aside out of his newfound respect for Jon. He watches with the rest of the Watch as Janos is beheaded by Jon for refusing to follow orders.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-12\"><a href=\"#cite_note-12\">[13]</a></sup>\n</p>\n<p>As First Ranger, Thorne becomes a part of Jon\'s inner council. When Jon proposes that they allow the remaining wildlings to pass through the Wall in order to escape the coming White Walkers, Thorne is against the plan, reminding Jon that they have been enemies for thousands of years and caused the deaths of numerous sworn brothers.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-13\"><a href=\"#cite_note-13\">[14]</a></sup>\n</p>\n<p>Thorne is later present when Jon departs Castle Black with Tormund for Hardhome to persuade the remaining wildlings to surrender, denouncing the mission as reckless and an insult to all the black brothers who were killed by the wildlings. He also quips to Sam that he is losing his friends, and by extension, his protection. It is possible that Thorne was in fact warning Sam about potential attacks on him and Gilly in his own, gruff way.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-14\"><a href=\"#cite_note-14\">[15]</a></sup>\n</p>\n<p>When Jon returns with the wildlings he managed to rescue from Hardhome, Thorne is visibly angered by the presence of wildlings outside the Wall, but gives the order to let them inside after Jon shows himself. As the wildlings are allowed through Castle Black, Thorne coldly quips to Jon that while he may have a good heart, it will get them all killed.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-15\"><a href=\"#cite_note-15\">[16]</a></sup>\n</p>\n<p>A while later, on Thorne\'s orders, Olly lures Jon into the courtyard, where Thorne claims they have captured a wildling who may know where Benjen Stark is. Thorne, however, leads Jon to a post with a sign marked \"Traitor\" as a group of mutineers surround him, and he is the first to <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Mutiny_at_Castle_Black\" title=\"Mutiny at Castle Black\">stab</a> Jon and say \"For the Watch\". Jon manages to push Thorne away, only for Othell Yarwyck, Bowen Marsh, two more officers and Olly to each take turns in stabbing Jon. He and the mutineers walk away and leave Jon for dead. <sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-16\"><a href=\"#cite_note-16\">[17]</a></sup>\n</p>\n<p>Thorne does not hide his role in the mutiny and manages to win over the majority of the Watch by reasoning that Jon was willing to risk the Watch\'s future through his allegiance with the wildlings. Effectively acting Lord Commander of the Night\'s Watch once again, Thorne speaks with <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Davos_Seaworth\" title=\"Davos Seaworth\">Davos Seaworth</a>, who is guarding Jon\'s body in a locked room with <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Dolorous_Edd\" title=\"Dolorous Edd\">Dolorous Edd</a> and other Black Brothers loyal to Jon, and offers him safe passage to the South with a horse and supplies, but Davos\'s mocking request for mutton convinces Thorne that they have no intention of backing down, but will fight to the death. Thorne promises Davos that if he and Jon\'s friends do not surrender, they will die.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-17\"><a href=\"#cite_note-17\">[18]</a></sup>\n</p>\n<p>Davos sends Edd to the wildlings for help, and they breach the gate of Castle Black with the help of the giant <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Wun_Weg_Wun_Dar_Wun\" title=\"Wun Weg Wun Dar Wun\">Wun Weg Wun Dar Wun</a>. Thorne attempts to rally the Night\'s Watch to fight them off, but they are severely outnumbered and terrified of the giant, and the rest of Thorne\'s brothers surrender. Only a handful resist, two of whom are killed. Thorne and the other brothers who helped in Jon Snow\'s execution are subsequently taken as prisoners.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-18\"><a href=\"#cite_note-18\">[19]</a></sup>\n</p>\n<p>After Jon has been resurrected by <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Melisandre\" title=\"Melisandre\">Melisandre</a>, he issues the mutineers\' execution. When Jon asks for his last words, Thorne disheartens Jon, stating that while he will rest, Jon will keep fighting. He expresses no regret for leading the mutiny, saying he prays he would have done the same thing over again even if he knew the outcome. Jon then proceeds to cut the rope to hang all of the mutineers, and orders Edd to burn their bodies.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-19\"><a href=\"#cite_note-19\">[20]</a></sup>\n</p>\n<p>Though Alliser Thorne is depicted as a stern, unsympathetic and sometimes cruel man, he is not inherently malicious or evil. His behavior and animosity towards Jon Snow and the other recruits of the Night\'s Watch appear to be due to his noble background and his distaste at how the Watch has become nothing more than a glorified penal colony. His resentment towards Jon stems from his dislike for Ned Stark, one of the rebels who brought down the Targaryen dynasty, which led to Tywin Lannister having him exiled to the Wall. Thorne has become a hardened and bitter person as a result, and does not tolerate weakness or cowardice, demonstrated when, for entertainment, he humiliates Samwell Tarly in the courtyard, and shows anger at Jon protecting him, telling him that being soft will not help Sam and will only get him killed.\n</p>\n<p>Despite his flaws, however, Thorne appears to be a fundamentally decent man, and most of his actions are dedicated towards protecting the Wall and the Seven Kingdoms against any threat from the lands beyond, no matter how unethical they may seem. He holds Maester Aemon and Qhorin Halfhand in high regard, outright admitting to Jon that he saw Qhorin as a brother, and valiantly leads the Night\'s Watch into battle against the wildlings and duels Tormund Giantsbane alone. Prior to the battle, he shares a moment with Jon and explains the difficulties of leadership to him, and does his best to encourage Jon to not lose heart, though this is possibly because he believed they were both about to die soon. Following Maester Aemon\'s funeral, he warns Sam that he is losing his friends, which could be his own gruff way of warning Sam of what is coming.\n</p>\n<p>His dedication to his goal and his distrust for Jon are also what lead him to spark a mutiny against Jon: in his eyes, by letting the wildlings pass through the Wall into the Seven Kingdoms to avoid the coming White Walkers, Thorne believes that Jon has committed the ultimate betrayal towards the Night\'s Watch, since keeping the wildlings beyond the wall was the very cause that most of their sworn brothers bled and died for, which appears to depict him as somewhat shortsighted, given his hatred for the wildlings blinds him to the true danger approaching Westeros. Thus, he does not stab Jon out of spite or envy, but out of anger and grief for his slain comrades, hence his words, \"For the Watch\" (although David Benioff and D. B. Weiss have hinted that Thorne\'s personal vendetta against Jon may have been a factor in his decision to mutiny against him).\n</p>\n<p>In his final moments, Thorne contemplated that it wasn\'t a choice of betraying Jon or betraying his personal interest, but rather the latter meaning betraying the Night\'s Watch - Jon had brought the Wildlings from Beyond the Wall and broken a crucial element of the vow he took, and in Thorne\'s opinion that justified his execution. Despite this, Thorne admitted that he had ultimately lost the battle he was fighting, and calmly awaited his execution, believing it was finally his chance to <b>rest</b> - however he still pointed out to Jon that the latter would be fighting their battles forever in Alliser\'s place.\n</p>\n<p>In the <i><a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/A_Song_of_Ice_and_Fire\" title=\"A Song of Ice and Fire\">A Song of Ice and Fire</a></i> novels, Alliser Thorne is depicted as far more malicious than his television counterpart. He is a respected knight for his service to <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/House_Targaryen\" title=\"House Targaryen\">House Targaryen</a>. During the <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Sack_of_King%27s_Landing\" title=\"Sack of King\'s Landing\">Sack of King\'s Landing</a> he fought on the walls of the city against the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Lannister\" title=\"Lannister\">Lannister</a> forces along the likes of Ser <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Jaremy_Rykker\" title=\"Jaremy Rykker\">Jaremy Rykker</a>. After the city fell to the rebellion, he joined the Night\'s Watch, being given the choice of taking the black or being executed by <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Tywin_Lannister\" title=\"Tywin Lannister\">Tywin Lannister</a>; this is most likely the cause of Ser Alliser\'s animosity towards Jon Snow, as Jon\'s father Lord Eddard was a prominent leader in Robert\'s Rebellion which forced Thorne into exile at the Wall. In a notable change, in the TV series Thorne is an experienced ranger who has been beyond the Wall on several occasions while in the books he rarely leaves Castle Black. He\'s described as having eyes as black as onyx and black hair ridged with white.\n</p>\n<p>Similarly to the show, Ser Alliser treats recruits contemptuoustly, giving them derogatory nicknames and turning them against each other. As a result, almost all the men he has ever trained during his years as master-at-arms despise him.\n</p>\n<p>It is Donal Noye the Blacksmith that tells Jon not to use his superior fighting skills to embarrass his fellow recruits. Jeor Mormont sends Ser Alliser to King\'s Landing with the severed hand of the animated corpse (it was still jumping and twitching), and he was ordered to lay it at Joffrey\'s feet. He thought that as a knight with old political allies in <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/King%27s_Landing\" title=\"King\'s Landing\">King\'s Landing</a> Ser Alliser Thorne would be more respected and listened to, and they would see the danger the Night Watch was in and send aid. However, when he arrived and asked for an audience it was Tyrion Lannister who was in charge. Tyrion asked if the one waiting was Yoren, who had become his friend. Remembering Ser Alliser, he told them to give him a room where the rushes hadn\'t been changed in a while. It was weeks before he got an audience and by then the hand had rotted away. After his fruitless return, he is sent to Eastwatch-by-the-Sea rather than back to Castle Black.\n</p>\n<p>Thorne, with <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Janos_Slynt\" title=\"Janos Slynt\">Janos Slynt</a>, returns to Castle Black much later than in the show, during the <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Battle_of_Castle_Black\" title=\"Battle of Castle Black\">Battle of Castle Black</a>. Their presence proves to be a hindrance rather than assistance: they seize command on the castle and interrogate Jon roughly. They accuse him of oathbreaking, cowardice, and desertion. Maester <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Aemon\" title=\"Aemon\">Aemon</a> assures them that Jon has already explained his deeds to him and Donal Noye, but they either don\'t believe or don\'t care. Jon repeats what he told before, that he was acting on <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Qhorin\" title=\"Qhorin\">Qhorin</a>\'s orders, but his explanations are rejected. Thorne, who always loathed Jon, accuses him of murdering Qhorin, suggesting that he is in league with <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Betrayers\" title=\"Betrayers\">those who murdered Mormont</a>, and that <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Benjen_Stark\" title=\"Benjen Stark\">Benjen Stark</a> may have a hand in all of that. When Slynt taunts Jon by claiming that <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Eddard_Stark\" title=\"Eddard Stark\">Eddard Stark</a> died a traitor, upon hearing the lies about his father, Jon\'s patience runs out. When Thorne grabs his arm, he yanks free and grabs Thorne by the throat with such ferocity that he lifts him off the floor. The Eastwatch men pulls Jon off Thorne and he is locked in an ice cell. Four days later, he is released. Unable to simply kill Jon out of hand (as <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Aemon\" title=\"Aemon\">Aemon</a> has rallied the brothers of the Night\'s Watch to support Jon\'s innocence) Thorne and Slynt order Jon to go to the wildling camp to <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Parley\" title=\"Parley\">parley</a> with Mance Rayder, but actually his mission is to kill Mance. Jon knows well that the wildlings will probably kill him on the spot, but he has no other choice but to do as he is told, knowing that a refusal will confirm the false accusations against him and give Thorne and Slynt an excuse to kill him.\n</p>\n<p>After the battle is over, Thorne continues naming Jon a turncloak. He claims that Jon failed to kill Mance Rayder because he was in league with him, but few believe that. Later, Ser Alliser is not a close contender to the post of Lord Commander, as many brothers resent his treatment as master-at-arms. Instead he withdraws his candidacy to support Janos Slynt.\n</p>\n<p>After Jon is elected Lord Commander, he knows he must deal with Slynt and Thorne, who have done their best to get him killed, for they will undoubtedly undermine him. Indeed, Stannis warns Jon that Thorne complains about the manner of his choosing, pointing out that the count was done by <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Aemon\" title=\"Aemon\">a blind man</a> with <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Samwell_Tarly\" title=\"Samwell Tarly\">Jon\'s best friend</a> by his elbow, and Slynt names him a turncloak. Jon decides to send Slynt away, and keep Thorne - whom he considers as the more dangerous of the two - close to him.\n</p>\n<p>Like it happens in the show, Alliser doesn\'t interfere when Jon sentences Janos Slynt to death; he reaches for his sword hilt, but changes his mind at the last moment, much to Jon\'s disappointment. He becomes more circumspect after his crony lost his head, but the malice is still in him. He is among those who object to accept the wildlings to the Watch, stating \"The realm will curse us all for this\". \n</p>\n<p>Jon doesn\'t give Ser Alliser any promotion. Instead he dispatches him, along with eight other rangers, to scout beyond the Wall. Thorne believes Jon is sending him to his death, but reluctantly agrees, stating venomously that he knows Jon would like nothing more than an excuse to kill him the same way as Slynt. Before departing, he ominously warns Jon that he will return to Castle Black, one way <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Wight\" title=\"Wight\">or another</a>.

They had two children: Jocelyn and Boremund Bartheon.\n</p>\n<p>Alyssa was the daughter of the master of ships, Lord Aethon Velaryon, and the granddaughter of King <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Aegon_I\" title=\"Aegon I\">Aegon I</a>\'s master of ships, Lord Daemon Velaryon. As a scion of <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Valyria\" title=\"Valyria\">Valyria</a> themselves, the Velaryons had always maintained strong ties to the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Targaryens\" title=\"Targaryens\">Targaryens</a> of <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Dragonstone\" title=\"Dragonstone\">Dragonstone</a>, and followed Aegon\'s conquest and forging of the Seven Kingdoms into a single realm under his rule. As such, they were prominent playsers at court for the whole of the Dragon\'s rule and even into those of his successors. When the Conqueror sought a wife for his sons, he had to look away from the incestuous practices of the Targaryens, his sister-wives having provided him with only two sons. To reward the Velaryons, he married his eldest son, <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Aenys_I_Targaryen\" title=\"Aenys I Targaryen\">Aenys</a>, to Alyssa in 22 AC. \n</p>\n<p>The match proved a great success. Alyssa possessed a Valyrian\'s beauty to match Aenys\'s, and their union was both happy and fruitful. Six children were born to them: <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Rhaena_Targaryen_(daughter_of_Aenys_I)\" title=\"Rhaena Targaryen (daughter of Aenys I)\">Rhaena</a>, Aegon, Viserys, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Jaehaerys_the_Conciliator\" title=\"Jaehaerys the Conciliator\">Jaehaerys</a>, <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Alysanne_Targaryen\" title=\"Alysanne Targaryen\">Alysanne</a> and Vaella.\n</p>\n<p>In the final years of Aegon\'s reign, a growing rift began to show at court over the issue of succession. None openly contested Aenys\'s position as heir to the Iron Throne, but the question remained of the position of Prince <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Maegor_I_Targaryen\" title=\"Maegor I Targaryen\">Maegor</a>, King Aegon\'s son by Queen <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Visenya_Targaryen\" title=\"Visenya Targaryen\">Visenya</a>. Before the birth of Alyssa and Aenys\'s children, Maegor had been second in line to the Iron Throne. Now, some argued that the Conqueror\'s grandsons (some even arguing in favour of the granddaughters as well) preceded him in the succession. Aegon never chose to clarify the line but two factions began appearing at court, each on favouring the rights of the sons of the Dragon. Queen Visenya acted as her son Maegor\'s foremost defender while Alyssa stood faifthully by her husband. Alyssa\'s great fertility was also a stark contrast to Maegor who, despite his marriage to Ceryse Hightower, had no heirs to match his brother\'s.\n</p>\n<p>Aegon kept Aenys close to him, training him to one day rule after him. After the Conqueror turned sixty in 33 AC, the prince and his wife took over the royal progresses that had been a hallmark of Aegon\'s rule.

Jaime Lannister, who worshipped Arthur in his youth, claims quite correctly that Arthur could easily best all of the current Kingsguard with his left hand \'<i>while taking a piss with the right</i>\'.\n</p>\n<p>He was an excellent tourney knight, defeating his friend Prince Rhaegar Targaryen during the tourney of Prince Viserys\' birth, and later breaking twelve lances against him at Storm\'s End but being defeated in Harrenhal.\n</p>\n<p>He was the second son of an unknown Lord Dayne. He spent his youth being taught the art of arms at <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Starfall\" title=\"Starfall\">Starfall</a>, and was eventually deemed worthy of wielding Dawn, the ancestral blade of <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/House_Dayne\" title=\"House Dayne\">House Dayne</a>.

Arya is wild, adventurous, unpredictable and extremely wilful. She absolutely hates the feminine expectations pressed upon her, in which her older sister Sansa absolutely thrives, and neither aspires in needlework or womanly graces as she does. Arya is incredibly spirited and very brave when need be, and completely capable of fighting for herself when she is backed into a corner. She is often quick to anger in some situations, but is also a fast learner in her own right and can quickly adapt to her own situation.\n</p>\n<p>What largely motivates Arya throughout the War of the Five Kings is vengeance: for her father, for her friend, for the injustices that have befallen her family. Arya has fallen into the obsessive habit of reciting the names of the people she intends to kill before she goes to sleep, and when she encounters certain people she has intended to kill she can often become reckless and frightfully violent, as evidenced by her brutal killing of the Tickler during the brawl at the crossroads inn.\n</p>\n<p>Arya longs to be reunited with her surviving family, and is devastated by all those she loses.

However, according to some sources, this is actually a parable for Baelor simply going to <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Sunspear\" title=\"Sunspear\">Sunspear</a> (a nest of enemies) and negotiating his cousin\'s release. Other sources say the story is true, but the vipers did bite Baelor and drove him insane for the rest of his reign.\n</p>\n<p>Whatever the truth, Baelor returned home having made a strong peace with Dorne and ensuring peace between Dorne and the Seven Kingdoms. Baelor had secured the release of his brother and also an alliance with Dorne by marrying his grand-nephew <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Daeron_II_Targaryen\" title=\"Daeron II Targaryen\">Daeron</a> to Princess <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Myriah_Martell\" title=\"Myriah Martell\">Myriah Martell</a>. With his newfound authority, Baelor dissolved his marriage to his <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Sister-wife\" title=\"Sister-wife\">sister-wife</a> Daena, but was still troubled by lustful thoughts of his sisters. To ensure he was free of temptation, he locked not just Daena but also his younger sisters <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Rhaena_Targaryen\" title=\"Rhaena Targaryen\">Rhaena</a> and <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Elaena_Targaryen\" title=\"Elaena Targaryen\">Elaena</a> in a chamber in the <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Red_Keep\" title=\"Red Keep\">Red Keep</a>, which became known as the <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Maidenvault\" title=\"Maidenvault\">Maidenvault</a> and they as the <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Princesses_in_the_Tower\" title=\"Princesses in the Tower\">Princesses in the Tower</a>. They were only 16, 14 and 11 at this time, respectively.\n</p>\n<p>The remainder of Baelor\'s reign was spent in prayer and piety. His uncle <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Viserys_II_Targaryen\" title=\"Viserys II Targaryen\">Viserys</a> continued to order and run the realm as the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/King%27s_Hand\" title=\"King\'s Hand\">King\'s Hand</a>. Baelor was indeed named a septon by the Faith, but their hopes that he would rearm them and restore the <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Faith_Militant\" title=\"Faith Militant\">holy warrior orders</a> were dashed as he believed that faith and piety alone were weapons enough, and in fact wished to disarm all of Westeros. His uncle prevented this and other outlandish notions from getting too far. Baelor spent a long time praying over the last three <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Dragon_Eggs\" title=\"Dragon Eggs\">dragon eggs</a>, hoping they would hatch, to no avail. Baelor was embarrassed when Daena escaped from the Maidenvault and returned pregnant, refusing to say who the father was. For this, she became known as \'Daena the Defiant\'.\n</p>\n<p>The last year of Baelor\'s life saw his religious fervour increase markedly, and he started to fast to purge himself of lustful thoughts. He went too far and starved himself to death. He was succeeded by his uncle, Viserys. For his piety and devotion to the Faith he was named \'Baelor the Blessed\' and the Great Sept of <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/King%27s_Landing\" title=\"King\'s Landing\">King\'s Landing</a> was renamed as the <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Great_Sept_of_Baelor\" title=\"Great Sept of Baelor\">Great Sept of Baelor</a> in his honor.\n</p>\n<p>Baelor was a peaceful, devoted and pious man. He was a pacifist and believed in words and faith rather than swords and threats. He could be fervent, occasionally passionate in his beliefs, and also stubborn to the point of recklessness, such as on the occasion that saw him lose his life. One of his most renowned tendencies was fasting himself to fatal degrees, often out of sorrow for the sins of others. He despised his own weaknesses and punished himself for his carnal and lustful thoughts, to the point that he imprisoned all three of his sisters in the Maidenvault in order to avoid being tempted by them. This fact, as Jaime Lannister at one point reflects, led to the conception and birth of Daemon I Blackfyre and caused the realm to bleed for decades to come.\n</p>\n<p>However, he was beloved by the Faith and by the <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Smallfolk\" title=\"Smallfolk\">smallfolk</a>, who were inspired by his holiness. While his lords and courtiers in majority grew to despise him, some believing him to be the feeblest king to ever sit on the Iron Throne, he is remembered very fondly by the common people, whom he had an undying love for. There are some who believe that he was a rare soul, untouched by the evils of the world - in a certain way, the opposite is true, as he was ruled by his fear of the evils of the world.\n</p>\n<p>Baelor would come to be known as <i>Baelor the Blessed</i> among the commoners and lords alike, and created a rather immortal reputation as a king who was far more peaceful than his combative older brother Daeron, and his lustful cousin Aegon. He also solidified his legacy with the construction of the Great Sept of Baelor, which became an almost legendary place of worship throughout the Seven Kingdoms, and where rested many of his successors after Baelor died.\n</p>\n<p>Baelor was handsome, but also very thin (due to repeated fasts). He smiled a lot and had long hair and a beard. He disdained royal clothing, instead preferring a simple septon\'s white robe. He rarely travelled anywhere without a copy of <i>The Seven-Pointed Star</i> and other holy books of learning to hand.

He burned down villages, stole crops, and killed anyone he was told to. He once cut the throat of a young boy as the mother, held back, screamed. That night, he could not forget the mothers screams, and became ashamed of what he was. After that, he became a man of peace, and an ordained <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Septon\" title=\"Septon\">septon</a>.\n</p>\n<p>Ray discovered <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Sandor_Clegane\" title=\"Sandor Clegane\">Sandor Clegane</a>, the Hound, in the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Vale\" title=\"Vale\">Vale</a>, apparently dead. He had a broken leg, and was covered in bugs. When Ray tried to bury him, the Hound coughed, so Ray loaded him onto a wagon and took him to be nursed back to health. According to Ray, the Hound appeared to die a dozen more times while he was helping him to recover from his near death experience, but always survived. Eventually the Hound became healthy enough to help Ray and his \"flock\" in the construction of what appears to be a small <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Sept\" title=\"Sept\">sept</a>.\n</p>\n<p>Ray and his followers, including the Hound, are building a <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Sept\" title=\"Sept\">sept</a> by a forest in the hills. He goes to talk with the Hound, and asks how many men it took to take him down. When he hears it was <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Brienne_of_Tarth\" title=\"Brienne of Tarth\">a woman</a> that wounded him, he laughs. During a lunching break, Ray sits with the Hound and recounts the story of his discovery. He asks what it was that kept the Hound alive, and is told that it was down to \"hate\", and being \"tough to kill\". Ray disagrees, and tells the Hound that he is alive because the gods have a plan for him. In this conversation, Ray admits that he does not know much about the gods and wonders aloud if the Seven, the Old Gods, and Rh\'llor are all the same deity; he concludes that the most important thing is that there is a force greater than humankind out there. Later, he tells the story of how he became a religious man to his followers. During the story, three riders from the <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Brotherhood_Without_Banners\" title=\"Brotherhood Without Banners\">Brotherhood Without Banners</a>, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Flynn\" title=\"Flynn\">Flynn</a>, <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Lem\" title=\"Lem\">Lem</a>, and <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Morgan\" title=\"Morgan\">Morgan</a>, arrive. \n</p>\n<p>Ray tells them the group has nothing to give the riders: no horses, gold, or weapons; only rest. The riders leave upon hearing this, and Ray refuses to fight them, claiming violence is a disease that should not be spread, despite the Hound arguing that it would spread anyhow if they did not prepare for combat. In exasperation, the Hound decides to go off into the woods to cut more firewood, saying that it would be a cold night. Ray offers to save some of the ale from dinner for him.\n</p>\n<p>However, later on in the evening, the building site is sacked and every one of Ray\'s followers are mercilessly killed. Ray himself is hanged from the rafters of the unfinished sept.

However, after the harrowing incident in which he killed the boy in front of his mother, shame washed over Ray, causing him to follow a new path.\n</p>\n<p>In the present, Ray is a wise, kindly man who dedicates his life to helping others. He reveals to his group that his main goal now is to \"bring a little goodness into the world\", if only to make up for the wrongs he committed in the past. He is not too proud to admit that he will be haunted by his terrible deeds for the rest of his life, including the screams of a mother whose child he had murdered. Ray firmly believes in redemption at any time, as shown when he tells his congregation that it is never too late for someone to turn their lives around.\n</p>\n<p>Ray is an extremely friendly man, capable of earning the admiration of a man like Sandor Clegane (who doesn\'t have very high opinions of anyone). Ray has quite a good sense of humour, laughing when the Hound admits that the one who managed to defeat and almost kill him was a woman. Ray\'s kindness seems almost uncanny, considering that he took under his wing a man with such a terrifying reputation as the Hound. Even when confronted by dangerous people who quite plainly threaten him and the people he cares for, Ray maintained a friendly exterior and even invited the members of the Brotherhood to supper. When the Hound confronts him for greeting followers of R\'hllor with a Faith\'s greeting, Ray bluntly answers \"I\'m a fucking septon, what was I supposed to say?\".\n</p>\n<p>In regards to the gods, Ray takes a somewhat universalist stance, stating that he does not know much about the gods and that the Lord of Light, the Seven, and the Old Gods could be the same thing, and that what he knows is that there is simply some force greater than humanity out there. Not wishing to bring more violence into the world, Ray has adopted a pacifist attitude and eschews violence even when threatened; unfortunately, this love of peace proves to be his and his followers\' downfall.\n</p>\n<p>Ray left quite an impression on the Hound, considering the fact that after his death, the Hound didn\'t hesitate on going on a path of revenge for him, and even referred to Ray openly as his friend\n</p>\n<p>Ray appears to be a combination of two book characters, Septon Meribald and the Elder Brother.\n</p>\n<p>Meribald is a septon who preaches to the common folk.

Meribald\'s tale of his past as a peasent levy is identical to the one Ray tells in Season 6 Histories &amp; Lore.\n</p>\n<p>The Elder Brother is a member of a community of male penitents living on the Quiet Isle. He tells Brienne and Podrick that he found Sandor Clegane, but that the Hound was dead and was buried by the Elder Brother himself.\n</p>\n<p>Neither of the two characters is known to have been killed like their TV series counterpart was. Sandor\'s return suggests that a future novel will reveal the Elder Brother\'s description was figurative: the Hound is dead, but Sandor still lives. A hooded gravedigger matching Sandor\'s physique appears in <i>A Feast for Crows</i> who could very well be Sandor himself; the character is left unnamed because the chapter is from Brienne\'s POV, and Brienne has not yet met the Hound in the novels.\n</p>','https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Ray','Brother_Ray.jpeg',NULL,NULL),(150,'Brynden Blackwood',0,0,NULL,'<p><b>Brynden Blackwood</b> is the eldest son of Lord <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Tytos_Blackwood\" title=\"Tytos Blackwood\">Tytos Blackwood</a>.

He had milky-white skin and red eyes, along with a blood-red birthmark on his right cheek resembling a raven. Some regarded his appearance as being unsettling. After he lost an eye on the Redgrass Field, he usually refused to cover it up, adding to his fearsome aspect. It led to the famous riddle \'<i>How many eyes does Bloodraven have? A thousand eyes and one</i>\'.\n</p>\n<p>Brynden Rivers was regarded as cold-hearted, fearsome, dangerous and ruthless, with only his half-sister <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Shiera_Seastar\" title=\"Shiera Seastar\">Shiera Seastar</a> apparently able to warm his heart. Although an able swordsman, his preferred weapon was his weirwood longbow, with which he was a master. Altogether a hale and highly skilled warrior, Brynden\'s greatest asset was his brilliance and resourcefulness, and his seemingly uncanny ability to collect information. As master of whisperers, he birthed a reputation for being a sorcerer and a spymaster, so much that he soon became one of the most feared men in Westeros, even more so than Prince Daemon Targaryen before him. Many at court, and even more throughout the Seven Kingdoms who only knew him by reputation, were terrified of him.\n</p>\n<p>Brynden was a completely practical man, unapologetically devoted to achieving stability in Westeros regardless of the means. He did not tolerate fools or sycophants, nor did he openly show emotion. His slaying of his half-brother Daemon Blackfyre shows that he sacrifices blood loyalty over personal loyalty, since he killed Daemon and several of his sons in a single stroke and bore the name of kinslayer for the rest of his life, but he extinguished the leader of a dangerous and destructive rebellion in the process. A century later, he would claim to have \'<i>A brother he loved, a brother he hated, a woman he desired</i>\'; the first is suggested to either be Daeron II Targaryen or Daemon Blackfyre, the second to incontestably be Bittersteel and the third to be Shiera Seastar. In fact, Shiera was his only vice, as Bloodraven was otherwise incorruptible.\n</p>\n<p>Brynden\'s skin was sensitive to sunlight, so he usually went cloaked and hooded, even in clement weather. He dressed in black robes and dark armour. His personal sigil was a white dragon breathing red flame on a black field. He wielded the Valyrian steel blade Dark Sister in combat.

As a result of this and their Houses\' natural enmity, Aegor and Brynden grew up as fierce rivals. Brynden was an albino with a raven-shaped, blood-coloured birthmark covering part of his face, hence his nickname of \'Bloodraven\'. Along with all of the noble-born bastards of the King, Bloodraven was legitimised on his father\'s deathbed and given <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Dark_Sister\" title=\"Dark Sister\">Dark Sister</a>, one of the two Targaryen <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Valyrian_steel\" title=\"Valyrian steel\">Valyrian steel</a> swords.\n</p>\n<p>His rivalry with Aegor and, by extension, their mutual elder half-brother <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Daemon_Blackfyre\" title=\"Daemon Blackfyre\">Daemon Blackfyre</a> (who was close friends and allies with Aegor), made him a natural ally of Aegon IV\'s legitimate son and heir, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Daeron_II\" title=\"Daeron II\">Daeron II</a>.

Although Tywin promised she would marry <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Rhaegar_Targaryen\" title=\"Rhaegar Targaryen\">Prince Rhaegar</a>, Cersei ended up Robert\'s disillusioned and resentful bride. After Robert\'s death, she became the grasping, murderous and scheming queen mother and self-proclaimed queen on the Iron Throne.\n</p>\n<p>She is described as very beautiful, and has many aspects classic of House Lannister, including her golden hair and her green eyes. She has fair skin and a slender figure, however she starts to gain weight during the series due to her high alcohol consumption and starts to lose her beauty with age. She always dresses extravagantly and accentuates her family\'s wealth at every opportunity. She is extremely similar to her twin brother Jaime.\n</p>\n<p>Cersei\'s amazing beauty is a mask for her true nature. She is wilful, grasping, instinctively narcissistic, extremely cruel, manipulative and ferociously determined to achieve her goals, no matter what the cost to others. She is exceptionally reliant on the reputation, power and influence of her name, so much that she has become blind to the deeply precarious position that <i>she </i>has put House Lannister in. Cersei is somewhat violent and temperamental, reacting aggressively when things don\'t go her way or when she feels she is being threatened, contradicted or undermined. She adores her eldest son Joffrey and spoiled him rotten, utterly blind to the psychopathic monster he became thanks to her doting. She is also somewhat ignorant of Tommen and Myrcella, the former of whom she sees as a poor replacement to Joffrey.\n</p>\n<p>She is actually rather intelligent in her own right, but has the fatal weakness of being extremely arrogant, selfish and narcissistic to a fault. Obsessed with maintaining her own personal power and totally crushing those she believes to oppose her, Cersei sees enemies in almost every shadow - most commonly she perceives her hated brother Tyrion to be behind all crimes that happen within close proximity of either of them, especially the murder of Joffrey. There are very few things spoken in her presence that she does not take personally. She believes herself to be brilliant and equivalent to her father Tywin, and is enraged when people do not respect her as they respected him, even though she behaves and strategises differently to him. Tywin never surrounded himself with sycophants so eagerly as she did, and his decisions were always firm and effective, whereas Cersei\'s commonly focused on whatever was troubling <i>her </i>at the time. Cersei is a hypocrite and unfaithful to Jaime, utilising sexual favours to other (lesser) men to get what she wants, yet expecting total devotion from him.\n</p>\n<p>Cersei has always been especially violent, resorting to physically traumatising an infant Tyrion whenever she lost her temper. As an adult, she threatened to murder her husband Robert if he ever disciplined Joffrey with violence again. Cersei carried out the massacre of Robert Baratheon\'s children without a shred of guilt, deeply offended by his unfaithfulness to her despite the fact that she surpassed his crimes considerably with her relationship with Jaime. She would react irrationally and almost childishly to open slights taken against her, or those she cares for. In many ways, she is actually similar to Rhaenyra Targaryen, who was fierce and proud and viewed as insane near the end of her life; like Rhaenyra, Cersei covets power for herself, but the difference is that Rhaenyra was well suited to the throne and had been trained to rule, whereas Cersei was neither, having been all but neglected by her father for her childhood.\n</p>\n<p>Cersei is categorised by the weakness that she is completely unable to sympathise with other people, the hallmark of a true narcissist. She always sees people, events and circumstances from a narrow and self-serving perspective, thinking that certain things people do are done with the direct intent of insulting or damaging her. She effortlessly used Sansa Stark\'s childish love for Joffrey as a method of defeating Ned Stark, mistreated and abused her throughout her captivity in the Red Keep, and yet seemed utterly awestruck at the idea that Sansa would \'betray\' her \'kindness\'. Cersei also refuses to accept responsibility for events she is directly responsible for; she played an utterly pivotal part in starting the War of the Five Kings by installing Joffrey on the throne, thus decimating her family and the Seven Kingdoms as a whole.\n</p>\n<p>Cersei\'s actions are influenced, in some way, shape or form, by the prophecy of Maggy the Frog she received when she was a child: she believes Margaery to be the younger, more beautiful one who will cast her down; she believes Tyrion to be the <i>valonqar </i>who will destroy her when she has lost everything; she is terrified of losing her other children, as Maggy prophecised <i>\'gold will be their crowns, and gold their shrouds</i>\'; she is aware and hypocritically resentful of Robert Baratheon\'s bastards, the six-and-ten children that the king would have according to Maggy. In the latter case, she is a total hypocrite, as she has fathered three bastards of her own and passed them off as princes and princesses - bastards of golden hair, increasing the certainty of her fateful prophecy coming true.\n</p>\n<p>Cersei rides to <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Winterfell\" title=\"Winterfell\">Winterfell</a> with Robert when he chooses to name Lord <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Eddard_Stark\" title=\"Eddard Stark\">Eddard Stark</a> as the successor to <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Jon_Arryn\" title=\"Jon Arryn\">Jon Arryn</a> as <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Hand_of_the_King\" title=\"Hand of the King\">Hand of the King</a>. She suggests that Robert not visit the Winterfell Crypts to see the resting place of <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Lyanna_Stark\" title=\"Lyanna Stark\">Lyanna Stark</a> but he rebuffs her. Cersei is escorted into the feast that evening by Eddard. <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Jon_Snow\" title=\"Jon Snow\">Jon Snow</a> sees through her smile and thinks that she is cold and angry. She later sneaks off to the abandoned tower of Winterfell with her brother Jaime. There they talk about Eddard\'s appointment and the threat posed by <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Lysa_Arryn\" title=\"Lysa Arryn\">Lysa Arryn</a>. They make love, until Cersei spots <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Bran_Stark\" title=\"Bran Stark\">Bran Stark</a> spying on them. Jaime tries to silence Bran by pushing him out of the window of the tower and reducing him to a comatose cripple, to Cersei\'s disapproval. Cersei is present at <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Castle_Darry\" title=\"Castle Darry\">Castle Darry</a> after the attack on Joffrey by <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Arya_Stark\" title=\"Arya Stark\">Arya Stark</a> and <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Nymeria_(direwolf)\" title=\"Nymeria (direwolf)\">Nymeria</a>. She insists on having one direwolf executed, and so has <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Lady\" title=\"Lady\">Lady</a> killed. Ned, who does the killing, has the pelt sent north, however, so that Cersei can never have the direwolf\'s furs.\n</p>\n<p>When <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Catelyn_Stark\" title=\"Catelyn Stark\">Catelyn Stark</a> abducts Tyrion, Cersei argues with Robert to the point where he strikes her across the face. After Lord Stark figures out the true heritage of Cersei\'s children, born of incest between Cersei and Jaime, he confronts Cersei and reveals that he plans to tell Robert the truth. However, Cersei has her cousin <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Lancel_Lannister\" title=\"Lancel Lannister\">Lancel</a> give Robert strongwine to dull his senses during a hunt, causing him to be fatally wounded by a boar. Upon Robert\'s death, Joffrey is King and Cersei has Eddard arrested for treason, although things turn awry when Joffrey has Eddard executed despite Cersei\'s wishes.\n</p>\n<p>A bitter power struggle erupts between Cersei and Tyrion, when the latter is named the new <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Hand_of_the_King\" title=\"Hand of the King\">Hand of the King</a> while Tywin is absent. Cersei uses <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Pycelle\" title=\"Pycelle\">Pycelle</a> as an agent until Tyrion finds him out and has him arrested, also sending Myrcella to <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Dorne\" title=\"Dorne\">Dorne</a>. Cersei becomes livid with her little brother, and arrests a whore believed to be sleeping with Tyrion named <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Alayaya\" title=\"Alayaya\">Alayaya</a>. She uses Alayaya as leverage over Tyrion, who proceeds to threaten Cersei. During the <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Battle_of_the_Blackwater\" title=\"Battle of the Blackwater\">Battle of the Blackwater</a>, Cersei stays in the <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Red_Keep\" title=\"Red Keep\">Red Keep</a> with the noblewomen, as well as Ser <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Ilyn_Payne\" title=\"Ilyn Payne\">Ilyn Payne</a> who is instructed to kill them all if the battle is lost to prevent them from becoming hostages. She also has Joffrey retreat, damaging the army\'s morale and almost causing the Lannisters to lose, if not for Tywin and the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Tyrell\" title=\"Tyrell\">Tyrells</a>.\n</p>\n<p>Cersei is furious after Tywin reveals to her that he plans to marry her off to either, as Cersei puts it, \"the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Balon_Greyjoy\" title=\"Balon Greyjoy\">old squid</a> or the <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Willas_Tyrell\" title=\"Willas Tyrell\">crippled dog boy</a>\". On Joffrey and <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Margaery_Tyrell\" title=\"Margaery Tyrell\">Margaery</a>\'s wedding day, Joffrey is killed at the feast when his wine is poisoned. Cersei, distraught, immediately blames Tyrion and his wife, <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Sansa_Stark\" title=\"Sansa Stark\">Sansa Stark</a>. While Sansa escapes, Cersei has Tyrion arrested, and Tyrion demands trial by combat. Cersei names Ser <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Gregor_Clegane\" title=\"Gregor Clegane\">Gregor Clegane</a> as her champion, prompting <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Oberyn_Martell\" title=\"Oberyn Martell\">Oberyn Martell</a> to become Tyrion\'s. The trial by combat results in Oberyn fatally wounding Gregor, although the latter still kills Oberyn, therefore condemning Tyrion to death.\n</p>\n<p>Cersei is awoken in the middle of the night by Ser Osmund Kettleblack and Ser Boros Blount, who inform her of Tywin\'s death at the hands of Tyrion, who has escaped his cell. She then walks to the <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Tower_of_the_Hand\" title=\"Tower of the Hand\">Tower of the Hand</a> and witnesses her father\'s corpse before ordering the disposal of <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Shae\" title=\"Shae\">Shae</a>\'s corpse. She later offers Jaime the position of <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/King%27s_Hand\" title=\"King\'s Hand\">King\'s Hand</a>, but he rejects her. She decides that her uncle, Ser Kevan Lannister, is more fitting of the role than her brother. At her father\'s wake, and is forced into conversing with Ser <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Lambert_Turnberry\" title=\"Lambert Turnberry\">Lambert Turnberry</a> and <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Falyse_Stokeworth\" title=\"Falyse Stokeworth\">Falyse Stokeworth</a>, and meets <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Taena_Merryweather\" title=\"Taena Merryweather\">Taena Merryweather</a>, and believes that she may be useful in the future. She rejects Lord <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Mace_Tyrell\" title=\"Mace Tyrell\">Mace Tyrell</a> when he offers to take the position of Hand and names Lord <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Gyles_Rosby\" title=\"Gyles Rosby\">Gyles Rosby</a> as <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Master_of_Coin\" title=\"Master of Coin\">Master of Coin</a>. She gives the dying Gregor Clegane to <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Qyburn\" title=\"Qyburn\">Qyburn</a> and is rejected by Kevan when she offers him the title of the Hand.\n</p>\n<p>Cersei then appears to her brother as he stands vigil over their father\'s corpse, asking him again to serve as the Hand, but again he rejects her. The next day she attends prayers, where Tommen is sick. She chastises him outside the <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Great_Sept_of_Baelor\" title=\"Great Sept of Baelor\">Great Sept of Baelor</a> for looking weak in front of his lords. She is impressed when Jaime devises a plan to rid her of Mace Tyrell whilst still gaining glory for herself and Tommen.

Margaery is imprisoned, although this plot backfires on Cersei when the High Septon grows suspicious of <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Osney_Kettleblack\" title=\"Osney Kettleblack\">Osney Kettleblack</a> and tortures the truth out of him. Cersei is arrested and imprisoned, while the Small Council tries to repair the damage Cersei caused. Cersei, meanwhile, sends a letter to Jaime, but receives no answer.\n</p>\n<p>Still imprisoned by the Faith, Cersei decides to confess in order to be free. She does not confess all of her sins to the <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/High_Septon\" title=\"High Septon\">High Septon</a>, however, and only admits to sleeping with <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Lancel_Lannister\" title=\"Lancel Lannister\">Lancel Lannister</a> and Osney Kettleblack. Cersei denies ever having slept with Jaime or having sired his children into the world, though the High Septon tells her that although she has confessed some sins, others must be determined in a trial. In the meantime, Cersei is allowed to return to the <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Red_Keep\" title=\"Red Keep\">Red Keep</a> until the trial, but first must perform a \"walk of penance\". Shorn of all her hair and stripped naked, Cersei is forced to walk through King\'s Landing, escorted by <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Faith_of_the_Seven\" title=\"Faith of the Seven\">septas</a> and Warrior\'s Sons, from the Great Sept to the Red Keep. Humiliated and hallucinating, Cersei eventually makes her way back to the Red Keep where Qyburn introduces Cersei to <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Gregor_Clegane\" title=\"Gregor Clegane\">Ser Robert Strong</a>, who will serve as her champion in the trial.

An unparalleled battle commander and seasoned warrior, Daemon wielded Dark Sister and was a frightening opponent. He was ruthless, cruel, proud, charismatic, violent, capricious, defiant and dangerous, easily resorting to combat and waging a personal war in the Stepstones with intent to root out a kingdom of his own, though it was well known that he personally desired the Iron Throne. Daemon was a ferociously daring young man, going so far as to ride a dragon without fastening himself to it, and relied as much on cunning as on skill in combat, both of which he had in spades. Daemon was a womaniser, a warrior, an adventurer, a commander, a schemer and a self-proclaimed conqueror, who constantly fought with his elder brother and antithesis King Viserys. In fact, he was so quarrelsome that he made enemies as easily as an eye\'s blink; ranging from the scheming Otto Hightower, to the proud Royces, to the young and rash Aemond Targaryen, his nephew.\n</p>\n<p>Even when put in positions of power, Daemon was a passionate sadist and easy to violence - in fact, he delighted in meting out bloody and savage punishments in his capacity as commander of the City Watch, killing several men in brawls and inspiring terror wherever he roamed in the city. His gruesome punishments were ones he often carried out personally. A man with prodigious appetites, he sampled multiple whores and had a liking to deflowering maidens. Despite this, he brought experience to his position, and ensured his men were better armed and trained when he rose to command; even during the Dance that split Westeros apart, his men respected him tremendously. He was considered widely to be the most dangerous ally of the blacks, equivalent to the younger and more brash Prince Aemond Targaryen. However, Aemond paled to the more cunning, more wrathful and far more experienced Daemon.\n</p>\n<p>Daemon was extremely arrogant and particularly callous in nature, completely aware of his powers and unapologetic about his misdeeds throughout his life. He jested about his brother\'s dead son once, drunkenly calling him \'<i>heir for a day</i>\', and callously insulted his own first wife as unattractive. Daemon\'s desire for the Iron Throne terrified and unsettled others, and many believed he would have been a worse ruler than King <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Maegor_I_Targaryen\" title=\"Maegor I Targaryen\">Maegor</a> before him.

Rhaella gave birth to Daenerys during the greatest storm in the history of the island, a storm which smashed the remaining Targaryen fleet ships to kindling in the harbor. This left the chances of escape very remote. With Rhaella dead in childbirth, the castle garrison seized the two children, planning to sell them to the Baratheons for their lives. Instead, Ser <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Willem_Darry\" title=\"Willem Darry\">Willem Darry</a> and several other loyal retainers rescued the children and spirited them away to safety in the <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Free_Cities\" title=\"Free Cities\">Free Cities</a>.\n</p>\n<p>Daenerys\' early life was spent in exile. Ser Willem Darry took her and Viserys from city to city, always one step ahead of the Usurper\'s spies and assassins. He eventually found them a safe home in <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Braavos\" title=\"Braavos\">Braavos</a>, where they lived for several years whilst Robert was unable to kill them without offending the most powerful of the Free Cities. Many times Daenerys thinks of the home she had there with a lemon tree and a red door, and longs for those days again. Viserys was kind to her and told her stories. He took her to the markets and bought her trinkets and sausages. Old and faithful Ser Darry died and the house servants stole their remaining money, forcing Viserys and Daenerys into exile once again. It was when the stress of their lives fell on Viserys\' shoulders that he began to change. When they had to sell their mother\'s crown which was the last thing they had of her, he started losing his temper and blaming her for their mother\'s death. Targaryens intermarry and Daenerys had always assumed that she was to marry Viserys.\n</p>\n<p>Eventually, Daenerys and Viserys were offered a safe home in <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Pentos\" title=\"Pentos\">Pentos</a> by Magister <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Ilyrio_Mopatis\" title=\"Ilyrio Mopatis\">Ilyrio Mopatis</a>, who suggested that Viserys wed his sister Daenerys to a powerful warlord with the military power to affect an invasion of the Westerosi continent. Although Viserys had planned to wed his sister himself in the Targaryen tradition, he saw the merit in this plan. <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Khal_Drogo\" title=\"Khal Drogo\">Khal Drogo</a>, a <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Dothraki\" title=\"Dothraki\">Dothraki</a> warlord with 40,000 riders at his command, was fascinated by the western girl from the sunset lands. He wanted a wife of royal blood and came to see her first at a party held at Ilyrio\'s manse. He agreed to the marriage in 298 AL. To celebrate the wedding, Ilyrio gave Daenerys <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Dragon_Eggs\" title=\"Dragon Eggs\">three eggs</a>, claiming they were ancient dragon eggs from the fabled eastern lands of <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Asshai\" title=\"Asshai\">Asshai</a>, they were valuable, but he had made a fortune in horses by brokering this deal. At the same party, Daenerys first meets a Westerosi knight named Ser <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Jorah_Mormont\" title=\"Jorah Mormont\">Jorah Mormont</a>, who was exiled from the Seven Kingdoms and has joined her brother\'s retinue.\n</p>\n<p>To Daenerys\' surprise, she found Drogo to be an intelligent and even gentle man, despite his outstanding prowess in battle, and they fell in love.\n</p>\n<p>Before sailing to Westeros, Drogo had to return to the Dothraki holy city of <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Vaes_Dothrak\" title=\"Vaes Dothrak\">Vaes Dothrak</a> to have the marriage approved by the holy women and to see what the omens were for an assault on the Seven Kingdoms. Viserys was unimpressed by the fact they had to travel several thousand miles eastwards rather than proceeding directly to Westeros. He became petulent and even unhinged as the months-long journey proceeded. As Daenerys became more confident in her role as a Khalessi, she stopped allowing Viserys to have power over her. Ser Jorah began advising her about leadership.\n</p>\n<p>When Viserys tries to strike Daenerys her guard prevents him. They offer to kill Viserys, but Daenerys won\'t let them.

Daenerys proclaims that his name will be Rhaego. Later at a feast, Viserys draws a sword which is punishable by death in the holy city and demands that Drogo pay for Daenerys or return her. Viserys also threatens to cut the baby out of her body so Drogo could keep it. He demands his crown.\n</p>\n<p>For these grievous insults and threats, Khal Drogo pours a cauldron of molten gold over Viserys\' head to kill him. Whilst regretful, Daenerys understood the necessity of this: Viserys was mad, and would make a terrible king even if he had achieved his dream.\n</p>\n<p>Daenerys now became the last of the Targaryen royal lineage and, in her eyes, the rightful ruler of the Seven Kingdoms. When an assassin sent by Robert Baratheon almost killed Daenerys and her unborn child, Khal Drogo flew into a mighty rage and decreed that Westeros would fall to his <i><a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Khalasar\" title=\"Khalasar\">khalasar</a></i>.

The fire was started and Daenerys, to the horror of her followers, stepped into the flames. Once the flames had died down, Maz Duur and Drogo\'s body had been consumed, but Daenerys was unharmed. The eggs had been shattered, and three infant <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Dragons\" title=\"Dragons\">dragons</a> had hatched from them. Daenerys named them <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Drogon\" title=\"Drogon\">Drogon</a>, <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Viserion\" title=\"Viserion\">Viserion</a> and <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Rhaegal\" title=\"Rhaegal\">Rhaegal</a>. Her Dothraki followers named her <i><a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Khaleesi\" title=\"Khaleesi\">Khaleesi</a></i> and vowed to follow her to the ends of the earth, and she named Ser Jorah Mormont as the first of her <a class=\"new\" href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Queensguard?action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Queensguard (page does not exist)\">Queensguard</a>.\n</p>\n<p>Daenerys led her retinue south and east into the desolation known as the <a class=\"new\" href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Red_Wastes?action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Red Wastes (page does not exist)\">Red Wastes</a>. This vast desert was harsh and unforgiving, and many of Daenerys\' followers died, including her maid <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Doreah\" title=\"Doreah\">Doreah</a>  who contracted a wasting sickness. Before they are wiped out they reached the ancient deserted city of <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Vaes_Tolorro\" title=\"Vaes Tolorro\">Vaes Tolorro</a>, known as the City of Bones. Here they found wells that were clean enough to drink from and fruit trees, and they were able to recuperate. Daenerys\' scouts found that they were not far from the great eastern city of <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Qarth\" title=\"Qarth\">Qarth</a> on the <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Jade_Sea\" title=\"Jade Sea\">Jade Sea</a>. Three emissaries from Qarth come to invite her to the city. They include the masked woman <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Quaithe\" title=\"Quaithe\">Quaithe</a>, the warlock <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Pyat_Pree\" title=\"Pyat Pree\">Pyat Pree</a>, and the trader <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Xaro_Xhoan_Daxos\" title=\"Xaro Xhoan Daxos\">Xaro Xhoan Daxos</a>.\n</p>\n<p>Daenerys travelled to Qarth with her followers. Her dragons were the wonder of the city and Daenerys hoped to win the use of a fleet of ships to return to the Free Cities, so she might begin plotting her return to Westeros. However, the merchant lords of the city consider Daenerys and her dragons  an amusement, and weren\'t  interested in helping her take Westeros; not seeing the profit for them. The Warlocks of Qarth have seen their power returning with the return of dragons and intend to find a way of keeping her and her dragons in the city.\n</p>\n<p>Xaro Xhoan Daxos is pale skinned and wears jewels on his nose. He invites Daenerys to be a guest at his manse and repeatedly asks her to marry him. She realizes that he does not physically desire her and that he only wants her dragons. The custom of Qarth is that after marriage each one has the right to ask one thing of the other. Eventually he tires of her refusals and politely tells her to leave his manse.\n</p>\n<p>Daenerys is told to come to the <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/House_of_the_Undying\" title=\"House of the Undying\">House of the Undying</a> to seek counsel from the <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Warlocks\" title=\"Warlocks\">warlocks</a>, as their visions would reveal her future, but instead of aiding her they try to imprison her there. Fortunately, she has brought <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Drogon\" title=\"Drogon\">Drogon</a> with her, and he sets fire on the ancient undead warlocks and burns the place to the ground. \n</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Pyat_Pree\" title=\"Pyat Pree\">Pyat Pree</a> the warlock who had brought her is furious and vows revenge. Luckily, Magister Ilyrio had despatched three ships to find her with one of his finest warriors <a class=\"new\" href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Strong_Belwas?action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Strong Belwas (page does not exist)\">Strong Belwas</a>, a mighty warrior-<a class=\"new\" href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Eunuch?action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Eunuch (page does not exist)\">eunuch</a>, and his <a class=\"new\" href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Squire?action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Squire (page does not exist)\">Squire</a> <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Barristan_Selmy\" title=\"Barristan Selmy\">Arstan Whitebeard</a> of Westeros. They are to escort her back to Pentos. Daenerys however never does what is expected. She decides to take the ships to slaver\'s Bay to buy herself an army.\n</p>\n<p>On the way back to the west coast, Daenerys\' ships passed close to <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Slaver%27s_Bay\" title=\"Slaver\'s Bay\">Slaver\'s Bay</a>. Realising she needed a larger army if she was to return to Westeros, she decided to travel to <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Astapor\" title=\"Astapor\">Astapor</a> to purchase an army there of the <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Unsullied\" title=\"Unsullied\">Unsullied</a>, the finest warriors in all the world, eunuchs trained from childhood to obey without question. In Astapor she found a sickening society based on the exploitation of slaves. Against the advice of everyone, Daenerys agrees to give her three ships, their cargos, and even her largest dragon, Drogon, to the slavers, but in exchange she wants every one of the Unsullied, even those still in training. Once the transaction is complete and she takes posssession of her army, ordering in her mother tongue of valyrian [ \"dovagedys\" (unsullied), naegon mebatas (forward march) , kaeletis (halt!), Zaldrizes buzdari iskos daor\" ( , a dragon is not a slave.) \"drakarys\" (dragonfire) ] she then orders Drogon, who is on a leash being held by one of the slavers to attack. Her dragons kill the slaver-lords and her army of Unsullied free every slave in the city. Daenerys puts a council of freedmen in power.\n</p>\n<p>She then marched north and east to Yunkai and besieged the city, threatening to destroy it unless they released their slaves. That done, she led her vast train of followers (now numbering in the tens of thousands) to <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Meereen\" title=\"Meereen\">Meereen</a>, which held out against her. \n</p>\n<p>Outside Meereen she learned that Jorah Mormont had sent reports on her activities to <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Varys\" title=\"Varys\">Varys</a>, King Robert\'s spymaster, and also that Arstan Whitebeard was actually Ser <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Barristan_Selmy\" title=\"Barristan Selmy\">Barristan Selmy</a>, of Aerys II and Robert\'s <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Kingsguard\" title=\"Kingsguard\">Kingsguard</a>, in disguise. Furious, she gave them a mission to prove their newly-proclaimed loyalty. They would go into Meereen via the sewers and open the gates. Despite the extreme danger, they succeeded and Meereen fell to her. After the conquest, Jorah refused to beg for mercy and Daenerys was forced to exile him.\n</p>\n<p>With the news that Astapor had fallen into infighting and ruin behind her, Daenerys decided to remain in Meereen and rule the city rather than departing immediately for Westeros. She realised she had little experience of rulership and command, skills that would be needed in the invasion of Westeros. This decision was not popular with some of her followers, who would have preferred an immediate return to Westeros, but Daenerys was determined to remain, and rule.\n</p>','https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Daenerys_I_Targaryen','Daenerys_Targaryen.jpeg',153,34),(197,'Daenys Targaryen',0,0,NULL,'<p><b>Daenys Targaryen</b>, known as <b>Daenys the Dreamer</b>, was a member of <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/House_Targaryen\" title=\"House Targaryen\">House Targaryen</a> from before the <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/War_of_Conquest\" title=\"War of Conquest\">War of Conquest</a>.

In 170 AL they had their first son, whom they named <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Baelor_Breakspear\" title=\"Baelor Breakspear\">Baelor</a> in Baelor the Blessed\'s honour. Three other sons followed. \n</p>\n<p>Daeron was already a grown man with children of his own when his parents had their youngest daughter, <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Daenerys_Martell\" title=\"Daenerys Martell\">Daenerys</a>, and when Aegon IV became king. Aegon IV was a decadent and dissolute ruler, and Daeron seems to have mostly avoided his father, preferring to spend time learning from <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Maester\" title=\"Maester\">maesters</a> and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Septon\" title=\"Septon\">septons</a>, being schooled on other cultures or engaged in artistic pursuits, all of which his father considered womanly and weak. Aegon instead doted on his eldest bastard son, <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Daemon_Blackfyre\" title=\"Daemon Blackfyre\">Daemon</a>. Daeron does not appear to have been keen on dwelling on <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Dragonstone\" title=\"Dragonstone\">Dragonstone</a> as the king\'s heir traditionally did, and instead was permitted to found a new castle at <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Summerhall\" title=\"Summerhall\">Summerhall</a>, where he and his family often dwelt.\n</p>\n<p>Late in Aegon IV\'s reign, it was whispered that Aegon IV had come to believe that Daeron was not his son, but the product of an illegitiate union between Naerys and their other brother, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Aemon_the_Dragonknight\" title=\"Aemon the Dragonknight\">Aemon</a>, and was planning to disinherit Daeron in favour of Daemon. In the event this did not happen, as Aegon fell ill and died suddenly, although he did legitimise four of his bastards on his deathbed.\n</p>\n<p>Daeron II\'s reign started with great promise, and soon he had repaired much of the damage done by his father\'s rule, including reforming the corrupt City Watch of King\'s Landing. He even paid for the wedding of Daemon and Rohanne of Tyrosh. Daeron was not a warrior, but was a skilled diplomat and peacemaker. Despite his many positive skills, there was still concern that he may not have been the legitimate son of Aegon IV, and that his far stronger and more charasmatic half-brother Daemon would have made a better king.\n</p>\n<p>In 195 AL, eleven years into Daeron II\'s reign, Daemon Blackfyre raised the standard of rebellion and claimed the Iron Throne. The reason for this is uncertain, but it is believed that it had something to do with Daeron pledging his sister Daenerys in marriage to Prince <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Moran_Martell\" title=\"Moran Martell\">Moran Martell</a> of Dorne in return for Dorne formally joining the Seven Kingdoms. It was said that Daemon, although married with two sons of his own, loved Daenerys and the thought of her marrying another was too much to bear. Furthermore, there was great disquiet in the realm for the growing influence of Dorne over the king, and the rumours over Daeron II\'s parentage had become quite well-known.\n</p>\n<p>The result was a year of warfare and blood, culminating in the epic <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Battle_of_Redgrass_Field\" title=\"Battle of Redgrass Field\">Battle of Redgrass Field</a>. Daemon Blackfyre\'s army marched on <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/King%27s_Landing\" title=\"King\'s Landing\">King\'s Landing</a>, but was intercepted by a force commanded by the newly-appointed <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/King%27s_Hand\" title=\"King\'s Hand\">King\'s Hand</a>, Lord Hayford. In the battle that followed Daemon and his two eldest sons were killed by his half-brother <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Brynden_Rivers\" title=\"Brynden Rivers\">Brynden Rivers</a>, called \'Bloodraven\', who had remained loyal to Daeron II. Daemon\'s other half-brother <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Aegor_Rivers\" title=\"Aegor Rivers\">Aegor Rivers</a>, called \'Bittersteel\', rallied the army and may have still achieved a victory until Daeron\'s sons Baelor and <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Maekar_I_Targaryen\" title=\"Maekar I Targaryen\">Maekar</a> arrived with reinforcements. Bittersteel fled over the <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Narrow_Sea\" title=\"Narrow Sea\">Narrow Sea</a> with Daemon\'s remaining sons and the sword Blackfyre.\n</p>\n<p>In later years, Daeron restored many of the rebel houses to the <a class=\"new\" href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/King%27s_Peace?action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"King\'s Peace (page does not exist)\">King\'s Peace</a> in return for renewed oaths of fealty and did his best to eradicate any lingering ill-feelings for the war. Daeron\'s commitment to peace and diplomacy earned him the name \'Good King Daeron\' or \'Daeron the Good\'. After Lord Hayford\'s death, Daeron made his son Baelor the Hand of the King, and this proved to be an excellent choice, as Baelor ruled wisely and well.\n</p>\n<p>Tragedy struck the family in the early part of the year 209 AL when Prince Baelor died in a tourney mishap at <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Ashford\" title=\"Ashford\">Ashford</a>, slain accidentally by his own brother, Maekar. This stunned the family, as Baelor held the promise to be a great king, maybe one of the greatest kings of all time. Maekar was tormented by guilt over this incident.\n</p>\n<p>Worse was to come. The <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Great_Spring_Sickness\" title=\"Great Spring Sickness\">Great Spring Sickness</a> swept across Westeros and killed tens of thousands of people.

Daeron\'s second son, <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Aerys_I_Targaryen\" title=\"Aerys I Targaryen\">Aerys</a>, succeeded to the throne.\n</p>\n<p>Daeron was a learned man, interested in wisdom and knowledge. He was often found in philosophical or historical discussions with maesters, or religious debates with septons. He was interested by other lands and cultures, and spent a lot of time learning about Dorne from his wife and those of her people who came to court. Daeron was a diplomat and negotiator, quietly confident and resolute, willing to listen to reasoned argument but firm in his decisions.\n</p>\n<p>In appearance, Daeron was unimpressive. He had thin legs and a pot belly, but was dignified, kindly and resolved. At odds with his demeanour, he wore his father\'s ostentatious dragon crown, possibly a reminder that he was the son of Aegon IV, no matter what the rumours said.\n</p>\n<p>Daeron was a fair-minded and respectful man, treating his half-siblings decently and honourably throughout the prelude to the Blackfyre Rebellions, honouring the decision of his father to give lands and dowries to Daemon. However, Daeron was capable of ruthlessness when it suited him (or at least when necessary) and took lands, castles and hostages from the lords who fought for the Black Dragon. This incited a certain amount of hatred from some of his subjects, who saw it as unfair treatment for following whom they believed to be the true King of Westeros.\n</p>\n<p>Daeron is remembered greatly and fondly after his death, considered a much better king than his father. He was loved by his family, and respected by his allies, to the extent that enough allies rallied to him against Daemon Blackfyre to defeat him. However, this is not entirely the case with some lords who loved and supported Daemon, such as Eustace Osgrey, who is left mournful and bitter from the \'mercy\' that Daeron showed him - he thinks that Daeron shamed him after the war, and \'made him small\', and that Daemon would have been a better king, though this rests almost solely on the fact that Daemon was a warrior, and Daeron most certainly wasn\'t.\n</p>','http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Daeron_II_Targaryen',NULL,153,NULL),(199,'Daeron Targaryen',1,0,NULL,'<p>\n<b>Daeron Targaryen</b>, also known has<b> Daeron the Drunk</b>, was <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Maekar_I_Targaryen\" title=\"Maekar I Targaryen\">King Maekar</a>\'s eldest son, and the elder brother of <a class=\"new\" href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Aerion_Tagaryen?action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Aerion Tagaryen (page does not exist)\">Prince Aerion</a>, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Aemon_II_Targaryen\" title=\"Aemon II Targaryen\">Prince Aemon</a>, <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Aegon_V_Targaryen\" title=\"Aegon V Targaryen\"> Prince Aegon</a>\n</p>\n<p>Prince Daeron was Prince Maekar\'s eldest son, not much is known about Daeron early childhood.\n</p>\n<p>Prince Daeron under his father\'s command was sent with his younger brother <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Aegon_V_Targaryen\" title=\"Aegon V Targaryen\">Prince Aegon V</a> to squire for him at the Tourney at Ashford, in hopes that his own sons would outshine his <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Baelor_II_Targaryen\" title=\"Baelor II Targaryen\">brother\'s</a> son Prince Valaar.

He shames Jon for this, pointing out to Jon that he has had advantages the others have not had: Jon was raised in a castle with a highborn upbringing and was trained under a master-at-arms his whole life while the other boys did not come from privileged circumstances and have never even held a sword before. Noye warns Jon that if he keeps going down this route, he will make enemies. This forces Jon to realize the rough circumstances the other boys grew up in and he begins training the other recruits himself, earning their respect and friendship. This likewise results in a friendship forming between Donal and Jon.\n</p>\n<p>When Samwell Tarly arrives at Castle Black, Donal refits armor to fit Sam\'s girth so he can participate in training.\n</p>\n<p>Donal is sometimes assisted by Jon in the armory. Before Jon is called to receive news of his father\'s arrest, Donal tells him, \"The gods be with you, Snow.”\n</p>\n<p>Donal Noye helps repair the Valerian steel sword, Longclaw.\n</p>\n<p>Donal asks Jon if he has heard the news of his brother Robb becoming King in the North. Jon has, still coming to terms with the brother he shared nearly everything with as a child is now a king. Jon tells Donal that Robb will make a good king. Donal tells Jon he hopes so. Donal had forged Robert\'s warhammer and tells Jon that Robert was never the same after he was crowned. He explains Robert was made for fighting but went \"to rust\" when he had to stop. When Jon asks about Robert\'s brothers Stannis and Remly, Donal responds, \"Robert was the true steel. Stannis is pure iron, black and hard and strong, yes, but brittle, the way iron gets. He’ll break before he bends. And Renly, that one, he’s copper, bright and shiny, pretty to look at but not worth all that much at the end of the day.\"\n</p>\n<p>As Jon prepares to leave, they say their good-byes and Donal tells him, \"May the gods go with you on the morrow, Snow. You bring back that uncle of yours, you hear?\" Jon promises they will.\n</p>\n<p>When Jon escapes Styr\'s group and returns to Castle Black, Donal is present. In spite of his injuries and exhaustion, Jon is happy to see him. Donal is concerned about Jon\'s facial scar he received from an attack by an eagle warged by the wildling Orell. As Donal takes Jon to Maester Aemon for treatment and says he thought he\'d never see him again, Jon reveals he was sent by the Halfhand to infiltrate the wildlings and gain information on planned attacks. He reveals Mance\'s plans to attack the Wall. Donal updates him on the events of Castle Black and is present while Maester Aemon treats Jon. Maester Aemon tells Jon the terrible news of Lord Commander Mormont\'s death in a mutiny at Craster\'s Keep. Donal aids Maester Aemon and they talk about the Magnar\'s men. Jon admits he broke his vows with Ygritte, a wildling girl he fell in love with. Donal holds Jon down as Aemon cuts the arrow out of him.\n</p>\n<p>In the Battle of Castle Black, Donal Noye takes command. He warns the villagers of Mole\'s Town about the oncoming attack and leads the defense of the Wall against Mance Raydar\'s army. When the gate is attacked and the giant Mag Mar Tun Doh Weg breaks it, Donal gives Jon charge of the Wall and leaves to defend the gate.

He is considered shapeless and soft, and looking older than he truly is. He is very difficult to read, and many people underestimate him for passive and meek, whereaas they admire his fiery brother Oberyn. \n</p>\n<p>Doran is an incredibly secretive and guarded man, to the extent that not even his closest family members (with the notable exception of his brother Oberyn) are incapable of reading him. Arianne Martell in particular is frustrated deeply by her father\'s stoicism and his lack of reaction to the atrocities that befell his own family. However, few people recognise him for the man he truly is: Doran is not only secretive, but excruciatingly careful, weighing the risks and consequences of all the actions he takes, unlike Oberyn, who always goes in with bare steel. \n</p>\n<p>He is haunted by the deaths of his sister Elia, his nephews and his uncle <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Lewyn_Martell\" title=\"Lewyn Martell\">Lewyn</a> during Robert\'s Rebellion, and has been orchestrating his revenge from the moment he heard about it. Doran is highly intelligent, having formed a plan of revenge on the Lannisters for a long time and understanding the weaknesses of those around him rather impressively. He is a consummate player of the game of thrones and, despite being unable to walk, he has proven to be almost as dangerous as Tywin Lannister himself. He is not well loved by the people of Dorne, which he is aware of, because of the multiple insults that have, to their mind, gone unavenged by the other kingdoms, especially the Lannisters. He acknowledges also that Oberyn resented him for this reason, but that they were both equally dangerous - Oberyn because nobody dared cross him, and Doran because all underestimated him for being different to Oberyn. \n</p>\n<p>Doran loves his family, mourning Elia, Lewyn, her children and Oberyn, but has also proven kind to the <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Obara_Sand\" title=\"Obara Sand\">bastard</a> <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Nymeria_Sand\" title=\"Nymeria Sand\">children</a> <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Tyene_Sand\" title=\"Tyene Sand\">of his brother</a>, and cares completely for all three of his own children, even though Arianne believes that she has disappointed him. \n</p>\n<p>In a way, Doran epitomises the words of his house - for all his tragedies, he has not bowed to anyone, not bent to anyone and not been broken by anyone. \n</p>\n<p>Doran learns of his brother\'s death after a letter arrives at the Water Gardens from <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/King%27s_Landing\" title=\"King\'s Landing\">King\'s Landing</a>, although he does not read it straight away.

Duncan grew to be a famous warrior, defeating several Blackfyre pretenders and even Lord Lyonel Baratheon, one of the fiercest Stormlanders of his day.\n</p>\n<p>An orphan growing up on the streets of <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Flea_Bottom\" title=\"Flea Bottom\">Flea Bottom</a> in <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/King%27s_Landing\" title=\"King\'s Landing\">King\'s Landing</a>, \"Dunk\" was chasing a pig one day when he was seen by a Hedge Knight. The Knight, Ser <a class=\"new\" href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Arlan_of_Pennytree?action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Arlan of Pennytree (page does not exist)\">Arlan of Pennytree</a>, had fought for King <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Daeron_II_Targaryen\" title=\"Daeron II Targaryen\">Daeron II</a> in the <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/First_Blackfyre_Rebellion\" title=\"First Blackfyre Rebellion\">Blackfyre Rebellion</a>. During the final battle of that conflict his squire, <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Roger_of_Pennytree\" title=\"Roger of Pennytree\">Roger of Pennytree</a>, was killed by a knight with three castles on his shield.\n</p>\n<p>Following the death of his squire, who had been his sister\'s son, Ser Arlan traveled to Kings Landing where he spotted Dunk in Flea Bottom, and offered to take him on to be his squire. Deciding that being a squire was a better option than being a thief, Dunk accepted Ser Arlan\'s offer, traveling the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Seven_Kingdoms\" title=\"Seven Kingdoms\">Seven Kingdoms</a> with him for the next dozen or so years.\n</p>\n<p>Ser Arlan was a good and honorable man who took his vows as a knight seriously. Dunk noted that although some Hedge Knights turned highwayman during lean times, \"The Old Man\" never did. Traveling to a tourney being held at Ashford Meadows when Dunk was about Sixteen or so (Dunk didn\'t know exactly how old he was), Ser Arlan caught a fever that killed him three days later. His last act was to knight his squire. Ser Dunk buried his old master on the west side of a hill, so that Ser Arlan could watch the sunsets.\n</p>\n<p>Ser Dunk decided to go on to the Tourney, hoping to become a champion, \"if only for an hour.\" Stopping for supper at an inn, Ser Dunk met a drunken lordling who was terrified of him; and a skinny, bald stable boy. Although the boy asked to accompany him to the tourney, Ser Dunk told him he was better off at the inn.\n</p>\n<p>The stable boy followed Ser Dunk to the tourney and set about squiring for him. The boy asked for his name, found \"Dunk\" to be a hilarious name for a knight and asked if it was short for Duncan. Wondering if it might be, and knowing that the most notable thing about him was his height (he was measured at one inch less than seven feet), Ser Dunk of Flea Bottom became Ser Duncan the Tall. His newly acquired squire gave his own name as Egg.\n</p>\n<p>What Ser Duncan learned later was that the drunken lordling was Egg\'s elder brother, Prince Daeron Targaryen, and that Egg was Prince Aegon, fourth son of King Daeron II\'s fourth son, Prince Maekar of Summerhall. Prince Maekar\'s eldest brother, Prince Baelor, Hand of the King, Prince Baelor\'s heir, Prince Valarr, and Egg\'s second  brother Prince Aerion were also present for the festivities celebrating the thirteenth nameday of Lord Ashford\'s daughter.\n</p>\n<p>Prince Aerion, destined to become known as Aerion the Monstrous, attacked some puppeteers, breaking the fingers of Tanselle Too Tall, a young Dornish woman. Ser Duncan\'s defense of the puppeteers resulted in a Trial of Seven which left Prince Baelor dead, killed during the fight by his brother Prince Maekar. Humbled by the death of his brother and the conduct of his two eldest sons, Maekar agreed to Egg\'s request that he be allowed to continue squiring for Ser Duncan, and they set off for Dorne.\n</p>\n<p>In the years that followed, they traveled through Dorne (failing to find the puppeteers), fought pirates, visited Egg\'s brother Aemon at the Citadel in Old Town, took service for a time with Ser Eustace Osgrey, and freed Lady Webber from the unwanted attentions of a determined suitor. They also helped prevent a second Blackfyre Rebellion at a tourney held to celebrate the marriage of Lord Ambrose Butterwell to a daughter of House Frey. It was here that Ser Duncan was formally introduced to Bloodraven, a reputed sorcerer and a bastard son of King Aegon the Fourth.\n</p>\n<p>Some twenty years later, Egg became King Aegon V (more commonly known as Aegon the Unlikely). Ser Duncan was again Aegon\'s Sworn Shield, as a Knight of the Kingsguard. Ultimately, he was raised to Lord Commander, the finest and most famous knight in the land.\n</p>\n<p>Although Ser Duncan had never approved of his squire\'s desire to hatch a dragon\'s egg, he was present at Summerhall when his King attempted to do so. The result was a disasterous fire that came to be remembered as the <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Tragedy_of_Summerhall\" title=\"Tragedy of Summerhall\">Tragedy of Summerhall</a>. Despite Ser Duncan\'s skill and great strength, he died, unable to save his king or his namesake, Duncan Prince of Dragonflies. King Aegon\'s granddaughter, Princess Rhaella, gave birth to a son, Prince Rhaegar, at some point during the disaster.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-0\"><a href=\"#cite_note-0\">[1]</a></sup>\n</p>','http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Duncan_the_Tall',NULL,NULL,NULL),(243,'Dunstan Drumm',1,0,NULL,'<p>Lord <b>Dunstan Drumm</b> is the Lord of <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Old_Wyk\" title=\"Old Wyk\">Old Wyk</a> and the head of <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/House_Drumm\" title=\"House Drumm\">House Drumm</a>.

With pale skin and hair as black as night and a beard, Euron is noted to be tall and well-built. Euron\'s most distinctive feature is his eye - he wears an eyepatch over one eye, and the other is described to be bright blue. His lips are also a pale shade of blue, since he developed a tendency to drink shade of the evening and gained these blue lips as a side effect.\n</p>\n<p>Euron is highly intelligent, cruel and dangerous in more ways than one. An extremely cunning man by nature, Euron is ruthless enough that he has developed a reputation as the worst of all the Greyjoys - he was responsible for most of the strategic actions during the Rebellion. He is a fierce warrior and a seaman of the finest calibre, albeit mostly down to his totally pitiless nature as well as his genius; Balon was the most ambitious, Victarion the strongest and Aeron the most devoted, but Euron is worse than any of them due to him being completely unscrupulous about what he does, and even abused his younger brothers when they were young. He has incited the permanent hatred of his brother Victarion especially, who has vowed to kill him but is stymied by the taboo o kinslaying.\n</p>\n<p>Euron possesses an effortless talent for leadership and charisma, and won over the other ironborn in the Kingsmoot because of how he expressed his awesome ambition, completely surpassing all of his competitors by appealing to the better nature of all ironborn, who were raised to believe that they were meant to reave and pillage and conquer. Euron was capable of turning his opponents\' insults against them, as he did with the suggestion that he was godless, which he met by stating that \'<i>from Ib to Asshai, when men see my sails, they pray</i>\', simultaneously bolstering his terrifying reputation. Euron was also sly enough to offer his crew the lion\'s share of his plunders, whereas most ironborn would reap the greatest rewards of their conquests.\n</p>\n<p>Euron was crueler to his allies and subordinates than his enemies, as he cut out the tongues of his crewmen and thralls.\n</p>\n<p>Euron fought with the rest of the Iron Islands to make his brother Balon Greyjoy the king of an independent realm and to bring about the return of the \"old way\". \n</p>\n<p>At the beginning of the rebellion, Euron devised a plan to sail into Lannisport and burn the Lannister fleet at anchor. The plan was carried out by his brother, Victarion Greyjoy, who led the Iron Fleet and destroyed the Westerlands naval force.\n</p>\n<p>Some time after the war,Victarion claims Euron raped his salt wife (though he claims she came to him willingly), and was banished by Balon, who warned him never to return as long as Balon still lived. Since his banishment, Euron has sailed his ship the Silence, which is crewed by mutes whose tongues Euron cuts out, to rape and pillage across the known world. Euron claims to have travelled to Asshai and beyond, and even to have sailed the Smoking Sea and walked the charred and smoking ruins of Valyria, where he found a magical Dragon Horn used by the Dragon Tamers of old Valyria to control dragons. He also once owned a dragon egg, but claims to have tossed it into the sea during a foul mood. Euron has fathered numerous bastards though unknown how many, many of whom are crew on his ship, but he has no regard for any of them. \n</p>\n<p>After his brother Balon fell to his death while crossing a bridge in a storm, Euron sailed into Pyke on his ship and claimed the Seastone Chair for himself.

Some found the timing of his return suspicous, since Euron was supposedly sailing far away seas, yet returned the very day after his brother died.\n</p>\n<p>Euron\'s brother Aeron called a Kingsmoot, an ancient gathering to choose a new king, in order to remove Euron from power, hoping to make his brother Victarion king instead. Victarion, Euron\'s niece Asha, and various other contenders all made their case, but it was Euron who won the election by demonstrating his Dragon Horn and promising that he would conquer all of Westeros for the Ironborn by using it to bind the dragons currently in the possession of Daenerys Targaryen to his will. When Baelor Blacktyde refused to accept Euron as his king, Euron had him killed. \n</p>\n<p>Euron began raiding <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/The_Reach\" title=\"The Reach\">the Reach</a> to great success, capturing the Shield Islands. Euron weakened potential rivals by giving lands and titles to their key supporters. He sent his brother Victarion and the Iron Fleet to find Daenerys Targaryen and court her in Euron\'s name, and bring her dragons to Westeros.

He is the brother of <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Sandor_Clegane\" title=\"Sandor Clegane\">Sandor Clegane</a>, who hates him and wishes to kill him. Gregor is a well-known sociopath, rapist, and murderer; he routinely tortured Sandor when they were younger, once shoving his face into a flaming brazier, raped and murdered Princess <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Elia_Martell\" title=\"Elia Martell\">Elia Martell</a> during the <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Sack_of_King%27s_Landing\" title=\"Sack of King\'s Landing\">Sack of King\'s Landing</a>, and also slaughtered her infant son, <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Aegon_Targaryen_(son_of_Rhaegar)\" title=\"Aegon Targaryen (son of Rhaegar)\">Aegon</a>. Gregor faces <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Oberyn_Martell\" title=\"Oberyn Martell\">Oberyn Martell</a> in Tyrion Lannister\'s trial-by-combat, and is killed. However, Oberyn died first, making Gregor the victor of the trial. His sigil is three dogs on a yellow field.\n</p>\n<p>Gregor Clegane is a gigantic man, arguably the largest man in Westeros (surpassing all of the Baratheon brothers, Hodor and his own brother Sandor), with great arms, an ugly voice like stone breaking, grey eyes, brown hair and large shoulders. His size means that he wears plate armour so heavy that no other man will be able to walk in it, much less stand or fight in it. His armour usually comes with  a plate helm with a fist punching up at the sky. As a result of his size, Gregor is unbelievably strong, widely considered the strongest man in the Seven Kingdoms. Wielding a six-foot greatsword, Gregor is virtually impossible to overcome, capable of cutting a man clean in half and even take the head off a horse with a single blow.\n</p>\n<p>The Mountain That Rides is one of the cruellest, most hated men in the kingdoms, and one of its most dangerous inhabitants. Instinctively extremely violent and aggressive, with zero qualms for savagery. His infamy throughout Westeros is that of a man who has slaughtered and terrorised thousands of people and commited crimes beyond counting or consideration; he has raped, burned, murdered and pillaged people by the score, all without a second\'s thought and without an ounce of regret or compassion. Gregor\'s crimes extend even further when one considers rampant rumours that he slew his sister, father and both of his wives - his father out of ambition to rise in power, making him lord of Clegane\'s Keep.\n</p>\n<p>Gregor\'s strength still inspires terror in other people, which is the main reason for Tywin Lannister using him for so long, considering him a necessary beast. Gregor is unfailingly obedient to anyone who gives him a bloody deed to do, following the likes of Tywin Lannister into battle and carrying out the man\'s orders in the most brutal way possible. Tywin himself admitted that he originally underestimated what the young Gregor was capable of, and that Gregor\'s worst crime of murdering Elia Martell and her children had been because he hadn\'t explicitly told the man to spare them.\n</p>\n<p>Gregor is one of the most terrifying warriors that the westerlands have to offer, and very few men are even brave enough to meet him blow-for-blow. One of these men is his worst enemy of them all, Sandor Clegane, who has hated him his whole life for leaving permanent burn scars on his face in a fit of cruel rage. Sandor has desired ever since to kill him, and has been embittered against the concept of knighthood as a result of Gregor\'s cruelty.\n</p>\n<p>Gregor is fully aware of his own strength, instinctively killing with his bare hands. He has a monstrous temper, going wild after being unhorsed in a tourney against Loras Tyrell and attempting to cut him down publicly moments later. However, the downside to all of this is that strength is all that Gregor really has - he is neither a strategist, nor a clever man, nor a genuinely skilled warrior. In fact, Oberyn Martell proves this by not only matching him blow-for-blow, but by repeatedly wounding him (something that hundreds of people have failed to do), through speed, skill and cunning. Gregor\'s wounds, wrath and pain compelled him to confess finally to the murders he committed of Princess Elia and her children.\n</p>\n<p>Despite the Hound being labelled the antithesis of the true knight, Gregor is in fact the true candidate for that, considering that knighthood has enabled him to do nothing but wreak total havoc across Westeros, and he does not respect nor care for the weak, poor or defenceless.\n</p>','http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Gregor_Clegane',NULL,38,NULL),(334,'Gregor Goode',0,0,NULL,'<p><b>Ser Gregor Goode</b> was an anointed knight of <a class=\"new\" href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/House_Goode?action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"House Goode (page does not exist)\">House Goode</a> and the brother of Ser <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Griffith_Goode\" title=\"Griffith Goode\">Griffith Goode</a>.\n</p>\n<p>Gregor was amongst the first knights named to the order of the <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Kingsguard\" title=\"Kingsguard\">Kingsguard</a> after it was created by King <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Aegon_I_Targaryen\" title=\"Aegon I Targaryen\">Aegon I Targaryen</a> in 10AC.

Kinvara is sure that \"Daenerys Stormborn is the <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/The_Prince_That_Was_Promised\" title=\"The Prince That Was Promised\">one who was promised</a>. <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Fire_and_Blood\" title=\"Fire and Blood\">From the fire she was reborn</a> to remake the world ...

Citing her freeing of the <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Slavery\" title=\"Slavery\">slaves</a> and her dragons as examples of her claim, Kinvara is happy to assist Daenerys\'s associates however she can. Before she and Tyrion can complete their agreement, Varys interrupts, pointing out that <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Melisandre\" title=\"Melisandre\">Melisandre</a> had proclaimed <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Stannis_Baratheon\" title=\"Stannis Baratheon\">Stannis Baratheon</a> to be \"the chosen one\" with a \"glorious destiny\", but Stannis was defeated by Tyrion in the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Battle_of_Blackwater\" title=\"Battle of Blackwater\">Battle of Blackwater</a> and died in the <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Battle_of_Winterfell\" title=\"Battle of Winterfell\">Battle of Winterfell</a>. He complains about how religion is overly self-assured of its own tenets; how everything is the \"will of the Lord\", and asks Kinvara why he should believe in her words when another Red Priestess was wrong. Kinvara states that everything <i>is</i> the will of the Lord, but that men and women can make mistakes. She asks him if he remembers what the voice in the flames said when the \"<a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Sorcerer\" title=\"Sorcerer\">second rate sorcerer</a>\" threw his man parts into the fire, or if he knows who was speaking on the other side, rendering Varys speechless. She asks if he needs her to speak the very same words, or to identify the speaker; Varys cannot bring himself to answer. As Kinvara turns to leave, she assures Tyrion that she will call on her best priests and preachers to speak about the Queen through all of <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Essos\" title=\"Essos\">Essos</a>.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-1\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">[2]</a></sup>\n</p>\n<p>In the <i><a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/A_Song_of_Ice_and_Fire\" title=\"A Song of Ice and Fire\">A Song of Ice and Fire</a></i> novels, the High Priest of <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Volantis\" title=\"Volantis\">Volantis</a> is a man named Benerro. He openly supports <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Daenerys\" title=\"Daenerys\">Daenerys</a>, claiming in his preachings that her coming is the fulfillment of an ancient prophecy; that she was born from smoke and salt to make the world anew; the dragons have come to carry her to glory; she is <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Azor_Ahai\" title=\"Azor Ahai\">Azor Ahai</a>. He demands that the Volantenes take sides with her against the <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Wise_Masters\" title=\"Wise Masters\">Wise Masters</a> and their allies. He claims that \"<i>Daenerys stands in peril. The dark eye has fallen upon her, and the minions of night are plotting her destruction</i>\". Meanwhile, the Volantene slavemaster noblemen hate Daenerys for her abolition of slavery in <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Slaver%27s_Bay\" title=\"Slaver\'s Bay\">Slaver\'s Bay</a>, and send a large fleet to reinforce Yunkai. The <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Triarch\" title=\"Triarch\">Triarch</a> Malaquo Maegyr wishes to silence Benerro, but does not dare use the city guard because half of them are followers of R\'hllor.\n</p>\n<p>It is unclear in the books if there is one ruler or ruling body for the entire Lord of Light religion, similar to the <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/High_Septon\" title=\"High Septon\">High Septon</a> or council of the <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Most_Devout\" title=\"Most Devout\">Most Devout</a> in the <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Faith_of_the_Seven\" title=\"Faith of the Seven\">Faith of the Seven</a>. There can be a single \"high priest\" (or priestess) for an entire major city-state such as Volantis, but how they coordinate with each other is unknown. Therefore, it is unclear whether Benerro (Kinvara in the show) is \"<i>a</i> leader\" in the Lord of Light church or \"<i>the</i> leader\".\n</p>\n<p>Instead of going to <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Meereen\" title=\"Meereen\">Meereen</a> himself to preach the message that Daenerys is the Lord\'s chosen, the High Priest sends one of his red priests, Moqorro. He travels in the same ship that carries Tyrion and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Jorah\" title=\"Jorah\">Jorah</a>. Like Kinvara, he sees things in the flames that he couldn\'t know otherwise: Moqorro tells Tyrion he saw Daenerys, and Tyrion as well, <i>\"a small man with a big shadow\"</i>, though Tyrion is skeptical. Moqorro also tells Tyrion about <i>\"a tall and twisted thing with one black eye and ten long arms, sailing on a sea of blood\"</i> who seeks Daenerys more than anyone else. This mysterious figure is widely speculated to be <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Euron_Greyjoy\" title=\"Euron Greyjoy\">Euron Greyjoy</a>, since in the books he has one eye, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Kraken\" title=\"Kraken\">Krakens</a> (depicted in the <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/House_Greyjoy\" title=\"House Greyjoy\">Greyjoy</a> sigil) have ten arms - although he has not personally embarked on a quest to seek Daenerys, but instead sent his brother Victarion to the Slaver\'s Bay for that purpose.\n</p>\n<p>Moqorro has a very frightening appearance: he is a huge man, taller than Jorah and wide enough to make two of him, with a belly like a boulder; his skin is black as pitch, his hair as white as snow which grows about his face like a lion’s mane; he has the flames tattooed across his cheeks and brow yellow and orange. He wears scarlet robes embroidered at sleeve and hem and collar with orange satin flames, and holds an iron staff as tall as him, crowned with a dragon’s head; when he stamps the staff butt upon the deck, the dragon’s maw spits crackling green flame. He has healing and prophecy abilities. He has nerves of steel and is not frightened easily, even if he is surrounded by a number of people who intend to kill him.\n</p>\n<p>Moqorro\'s ship is badly damaged in a storm, and he is swept overboard. After being adrift for several days, Moqorro is rescued by Victarion Greyjoy, who was sent to Meereen by Euron to propose to Daenerys in his name, though in fact, Victarion intends to steal Euron\'s plan and marry her himself. Though the ironborn are initially hostile to this priest of a foreign deity, Victarion grows to trust Moqorro, since he heals Victarion and his visions prove to be correct.\n</p>\n<p>As time passes, Victarion becomes convinced that the drowned god has sent him Moqorro to guide him on his perilous voyage. The crew, however, feels uncomfortable in the priest\'s presence. In attempt to make the crew accept Moqorro, Victarion orders one of his men to sew new robes for him, to replace his worn red robe, and even donates some of his own tunics, dyed black and gold and bearing the golden Kraken sigil - but it works the opposite: clad in black from head to heel, with a mask of red-and-orange flames tattooed across his face, the priest appears to the crew even more sinister than before. They shun him when he walks the deck, and spit if his shadow chances to fall upon them. They call him \"the Black Flame\", a name fastened on him by the ironborn Steffar Stammerer, who could not pronounce Moqorro\'s name.\n</p>\n<p>When the fleet gets closer to the Slaver\'s Bay, Victarion feels he can trust Moqorro enough to consult with him about Dragonbinder, the horn Euron gave him for controlling Daenerys\'s dragons, and he even burns several captured bed-slaves as a sacrifice to both the Lord of Light and the Drowned God.\n</p>\n<p>By the point the published books reached, Victarion and Moqorro are heading for Meereen, but have not reached yet, and Daenerys remains in the Dothraki Sea. As such, in the TV show, the Benerro-Moqorro subplot (adapted with Kinvara instead) has advanced further than the published source material, with Red Priests already working directly with the Queen\'s council.\n</p>\n<p>Apparently, Moqorro is the person whom Quaithe referred to as \"dark flame\".\n</p>','https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Kinvara','High_Priestess.jpeg',NULL,8),(389,'High Septon',0,0,NULL,'<p><b>Tyrion\'s High Septon</b> was the successor to the previous <a class=\"new\" href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/High_Septon_(Fat_One)?action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"High Septon (Fat One) (page does not exist)\">High Septon</a>.

Whilst Maegor the Cruel had brutally suppressed the <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Faith_of_the_Seven\" title=\"Faith of the Seven\">Faith of the Seven</a> during the uprising, Jaehaerys adopted a path of negotiation, his friendship with Septon Barth helping him understand the Faith. In return for the Faith\'s surrender and the disbanding of its militant orders, the <a class=\"new\" href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Warrior%27s_Sons?action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Warrior\'s Sons (page does not exist)\">Warrior\'s Sons</a> and <a class=\"new\" href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Poor_Fellows?action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Poor Fellows (page does not exist)\">Poor Fellows</a>, the Faith would suffer no further oppression and the Targaryens would return to being their staunch supporters.

The Faith agreed to these terms. For ending the war peacefully and restoring the relations of the crown and church, Jaehaerys was dubbed \'Jaehaerys the Conciliator\'.\n</p>\n<p>Jaehaerys ruled for fifty-five years, more than any other king in modern history, outliving two of his sons and heirs; Aemon and Baelon. Unfortunately, of the thirteen children he and Alysanne ever had, only nine lived into adulthood. In later life Jaehaerys also became known as the \'Old King\', but this was meant respectfully. He set to work on many great deeds and was a skilled negotiator and peace-maker. He and his <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Sister-wife\" title=\"Sister-wife\">sister-wife</a> Alysannae worked as a formidable team, setting the realm to rights and ending outdated practises (such as the old tradition of <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/First_night\" title=\"First night\">first night</a>). Alysannae was also a great believer in the <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Night%27s_Watch\" title=\"Night\'s Watch\">Night\'s Watch</a>, and at her urging Jaehaerys supported the Watch, sending them more men and helping reinforce the castles along the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Wall\" title=\"Wall\">Wall</a>, as well as funding the construction of <a class=\"new\" href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Deep_Lake?action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Deep Lake (page does not exist)\">Deep Lake</a> castle to replace the <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Nightfort\" title=\"Nightfort\">Nightfort</a> when it was abandoned. Alysanne was also a great supporter of the <a class=\"new\" href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Commons?action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Commons (page does not exist)\">commons</a>, sponsoring many charities to help the lot of the smallfolk.\n</p>\n<p>Jaehaerys and Alysanne were beloved by the people and respected by the nobility for restoring Westeros to peace and plenty after decades of turmoil and war. \n</p>\n<p>After his two eldest sons Aemon and Baelon died before him, he called for a council and chose his grandson Viserys, Baelon\'s eldest son, as heir, passing over his granddaughter Rhaenys, Aemon\'s daughter, and Rhaenys\' seven year old son Laenor. \n</p>\n<p>Tragically Queen Alysanne died of grief a year after the suicide of their youngest child, Princess Gael. With the death of his beloved wife and son Baelon, Jaehaerys spent the last few years of his reign bed ridden, while his new Hand <a class=\"new\" href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Otto_Hightower?action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Otto Hightower (page does not exist)\">Otto Hightower</a> ruled the realm, and Otto\'s daughter <a class=\"new\" href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Allicent_Hightower?action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Allicent Hightower (page does not exist)\">Allicent</a> looked after him.

He flew several times to aid the Night\'s Watch against the wildlings.\n</p>\n<p>Jaehaerys I Targaryen is mostly remembered and depicted in old age. At this time he had the appearance of old, dignified wisdom. He was elderly but unstooped, and very tall. He had an impressive white beard that reached to his waist and preferred to wear flowing robes of black and gold. Typical of his house, his eyes were purple, and as a youth he was very handsome. He had a new crown commissioned, a simple gold band set with seven gemstones of different colours, as opposed to wearing the warlike crown of his grandfather and uncle. He typically did not wield a sword, though he was exceptionally skilled with both blade and lance - he saw this as a way of avoiding the mistake that his father made, of being viewed as weak. Jaehaerys was beloved by his descendants, and brought abundance to all of Westeros in his reign, which his grandchildren would rather unfortunately bring disarray to with the Dance of the Dragons.\n</p>\n<p>Jaehaerys, starkly unlike either <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Aegon_I_Targaryen\" title=\"Aegon I Targaryen\">of</a> <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Aenys_I_Targaryen\" title=\"Aenys I Targaryen\">his</a> <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Maegor_I_Targaryen\" title=\"Maegor I Targaryen\">predecessors</a>, was both a careful thinker, a planner and a diplomat. He was courteous but firm, resolute but not unyielding to argument. He cared fiercely for the people of Westeros, but was not a dreamer like some of his successors - he was not blinded by delusions of conquest, greatness or might, and lacked the Targaryen madness that seemed to plague his family. His plans were realistic and achievable, even when generous - he built the Kingsroad, among other roads to ease transport throughout the Seven Kingdoms, as well as abolishing the right to first night with the persuasion of his queen. He deeply loved his wife Alysanne, his closest confidante, thought they quarrelled ferociously on occasion. He loved her so much that he was truly broken by her death, as well as that of his son Baelon, leaving him a broken shell of a man. It is known that he had one of the healthiest relationships with his spouse than most of the Targaryens - he never took any mistresses, as Maegor the Cruel, Aerys the Mad and Aegon the Unworthy did.\n</p>\n<p>Jaehaerys was a great king, perhaps the greatest of all the Targaryen kings, and reigned the longest out of all of them - even after the Targaryens were extinguished, he is considered the mightiest and wisest monarch who ever lived, though not all of his reforms remain by the time of the War of the Five Kings. He faced few, if any rebellions, and his reforms, policies and achievements were applauded and fondly remembered by all of Westeros. It is worth noting that one of Jaehaerys\' most infamous decision was to choose Septon Barth, a commoner he befriended in the library of the Red Keep, as Hand of the King - a post traditionally afforded to noblemen - in recognition of the man\'s brilliance and wisdom. He sent Barth to Oldtown to reconcile with the Faith, as opposed to bringing war upon them. Barth and Jaehaerys worked together to forge peace throughout the Seven Kingdoms. After he died, even the inhabitants of Dorne (where the Targaryen rule was not absolute) mourned for him.\n</p>','http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Jaehaerys_I_Targaryen',NULL,153,NULL),(425,'Jaime Lannister',1,1,'The Queen\'s twin brother.

He is perceived as being arrogant, cruel, sarcastic and dishonourable to an extreme - anyone with a perception of personal honour appears to hate Jaime in this regard, and only ever refer to him as the Kingslayer. Jaime <i>is </i>arrogant and sarcastic, and has proven capable of murder and deceit in pursuit of his objectives, but he is one of the most complicated people in the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Seven_Kingdoms\" title=\"Seven Kingdoms\">Seven Kingdoms</a>. The real reason he killed King Aerys was because the psychopathic king sought to obliterate the entirety of <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/King%27s_Landing\" title=\"King\'s Landing\">King\'s Landing</a> with <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Wildfire\" title=\"Wildfire\">wildfire</a>, and had commanded Jaime to kill his own father, and therefore Jaime committed his heinous crime (which he views sometimes as his greatest act) with honourable motivations.\n</p>\n<p>Jaime has always been supremely skilled in combat, which is his singular interest - he understands, but does not care much for political manoeuvring and would rather be a soldier than anything else. A master swordsman who was renowned even as a young age, Jaime is not unbeatable (which he himself admits) but has the instincts and experience of a warrior. When he loses his sword hand, he is shocked and traumatized, having relied on his fighting skills for so long, but he becomes more reliant on his wits than before and even becomes less arrogant and more respectful of others - however, he maintains the pride and temper of a lion.\n</p>\n<p>An extremely complicated aspect of Jaime\'s personality is the fact that he loves <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Cersei_Lannister\" title=\"Cersei Lannister\">Cersei</a> - he has never in his life slept with another woman but her, and she considers him utterly devoted to her. Throughout the <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/War_of_the_Five_Kings\" title=\"War of the Five Kings\">War of the Five Kings</a>, Jaime is motivated by this love - his acts of attempting to murder <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Bran_Stark\" title=\"Bran Stark\">Brandon Stark</a>, his violent attempts at escape from <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Brienne_Tarth\" title=\"Brienne Tarth\">Brienne Tarth</a>, and his actions throughout their journey are spurred by his love for his sister. When he finally returns to King\'s Landing, and begins to realize the woman Cersei has become and how people expect him to act, he begins to doubt the severity of his love, which is made excruciating when he learns from <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Tyrion_Lannister\" title=\"Tyrion Lannister\">Tyrion</a> that Cersei has betrayed him to other men, including their cousin <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Lancel_Lannister\" title=\"Lancel Lannister\">Lancel</a>, who is openly considered to be a very poor imitation of Jaime.\n</p>\n<p>Jaime is also one of the very few Lannisters to have any respect or adoration for Tyrion, whom he has cared for all of the man\'s life. He respects Tyrion\'s intelligence and selflessness, and does not hate him for being a dwarf, unlike both their father and especially their sister. However, this love is essentially decimated when Tyrion vengefully kills Tywin, only made possible because Jaime released him. The tragic irony of this is that the murder of Tywin Lannister was partly because Jaime also revealed that the <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Shae\" title=\"Shae\">woman</a> that Tywin had damaged, who had been Tyrion\'s lover, was not a whore; this caused Tyrion\'s hatred and contempt for their father to become uncontrollable and motivate him into his heinous act.\n</p>\n<p>There are very few people that Jaime genuinely respects - he does not hold his father in truly high regard, nor does he mourn for the Mad King, and he is openly hateful of the Freys and Starks. He considered Robb Stark to be his enemy, and is frustrated by being unable to finish him off when he was captured. The difference from Cersei is that Jaime knows the boundaries of decorum, even with people he doesn\'t like, and is able to maintain at least some civil conversation with them. Despite all of this, he is remarked to be the least like Tywin out of the latter\'s sons, and that he rather shares the qualities of Tywin\'s brothers - he favours combat and charm, rather than political savvy.\n</p>\n<p>Jaime rides north when Robert Baratheon decides to replace the recently deceased <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Jon_Arryn\" title=\"Jon Arryn\">Jon Arryn</a> with Lord <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Eddard_Stark\" title=\"Eddard Stark\">Eddard Stark</a> as <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Hand_of_the_King\" title=\"Hand of the King\">Hand of the King</a>. He is amongst those that sit at the high lords table for the celebratory feast, entering the great hall alongside his younger brother.\n</p>\n<p>Jaime uses the abandoned tower of Winterfell to secretly meet with his sister. Here they talk about the appointment of Eddard and the threat that <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Lysa_Arryn\" title=\"Lysa Arryn\">Lysa Arryn</a> poses. <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Bran_Stark\" title=\"Bran Stark\">Bran Stark</a> overhears them and then witnesses them having sexual intercourse in the tower. For this Jaime throws him out of a high window.\n</p>\n<p>Four days later he is informed by Tyrion that Maester <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Luwin\" title=\"Luwin\">Luwin</a> believes that Bran is going to live. He is defeated during the Tourney of the Hand by Sandor Clegane ,but manages to unhorse Ser Barristan Selmy himself.\n</p>\n<p>For the attempted murder of Bran Stark, Tyrion is falsely arrested; in retaliation, Ser Jaime confronts Eddard Stark in the streets of King\'s Landing. When Ned argues that any attempt on his life will only give Catelyn cause to kill Tyrion, Jaime orders his men to kill the northern guards. Ned is gravely injured during the brawl that follows, but does indeed survive, while Jaime flees the city and heads to Casterly Rock.\n</p>\n<p>During the early stages of what becomes the War of the Five Kings, Jaime wins a number of battles, at the Golden Tooth and Riverrun. At the same time, after King Robert\'s death and Joffrey\'s coronation, Ser Barristan Selmy is dismissed from the KIngsguard, making Jaime the new Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.\n</p>\n<p>During the Battle of the Whispering Wood, despite eventually losing the battle, Jaime attempts to cut down Robb Stark himself, killing Eddard and Torrhen Karstark before being taken prisoner. When brought before Robb after the battle, many of Robb\'s bannermen are desirous for Jaime\'s execution, and the Kingslayer is routinely protected from them, especially Rickard Karstarks, who lost two sons to Jaime\'s sword.\n</p>\n<p>Tyrion promises to achieve Jaime\'s release upon being appointed as acting Hand of the King. However, the bloody escape attempt that follows as a result of Tyrion\'s plan fails, and Jaime is confined to a cell in Riverrun, chained to a wall. In his absence, and without his knowledge, Cersei takes their cousin Lancel into her bed and makes him her lover.\n</p>\n<p>Jaime is visited by Catelyn Stark, who interrogates him and gets him drunk. He confesses to being the father of Joffrey, Tommen and Myrcella, but denies being the architect of the attempt of Bran\'s life, as he would have done it himself otherwise. Eventually, however, Jaime steers the conversation towards Brandon Stark and his father Rickard. He tells Catelyn the gruesome story of how the two men died at the hands of the Mad King, and how the Kingsguard present did nothing about it. He then taunts Catelyn with the existence of Jon Snow, proof that Ned Stark loved another woman. Catelyn angrily orders for Brienne of Tarth\'s sword.\n</p>\n<p>Jaime is released from custody by Catelyn, in defiance of her son, out of a desperate attempt to exchange the Kingslayer for her two daughters. Along with his fellow captive and cousin, Ser Cleos Frey, he is escorted by Brienne of Tarth. Jaime shaves his head but keeps his beard, so that he is not recognised. He hates Brienne on sight and they frequently trade barbs.\n</p>\n<p>They evade capture several times by a hunting party sent by Robb to recapture Jaime, but are unable to shake off their pursuers for long. On the way to Duskendale, Ser Cleos is killed during a skirmish with bandits. Jaime steals his sword and challenges Brienne, having grown tired of being her captive. The two of them engage in a vicious battle, and Jaime is shocked to realise that the woman is a match for him. The fight is interrupted by outlaws of the Brave Companions commanded by Vargo Hoat.\n</p>\n<p>Vargo believes that his commander, Roose Bolton of the Dreadfort, is considering siding with the Lannisters following the Battle of Blackwater Bay. In order to stop this, Vargo has Jaime\'s hand cut off. Jaime is traumatised by his maiming, having relied on his fighting ability all of his life. He descends into a depression, until Brienne compels him to continue on living so that he can take revenge.\n</p>\n<p>After arriving at Harrenhal and being taken into Bolton\'s custody, Jaime and Brienne share a bath. While in a mad fever, Jaime divulges his side of the Sack of King\'s Landing and how he slew the Mad King. While dining, Roose Bolton explains that Jaime will be released if he does not blame the Leech Lord for his maiming. When Jaime agrees, he is released, but Brienne is left behind for the entertainment of Vargo Hoat. However, Jaime returns to Harrenhal and rescues Brienne from Hoat.\n</p>\n<p>Jaime learns on the road about the Red Wedding. When he returns to King\'s Landing, he learns also of his son Joffrey\'s death at the Purple Wedding. Upon his return, he is confronted by Ser Loras Tyrell, who has joined the Kingsguard. When the Knight of Flowers accuses Brienne for Renly\'s murder, Jaime persuades him to imprison her rather than facing her with bare steel. He then proceeds to the Sept of Baelor to see Cersei at last, consequently meeting Osmund Kettleblack, who aggressively mistakes him for a peasant. When he finally meets Cersei, they have sex next to Joffrey\'s dead body.\n</p>\n<p>After this encounter, Jaime and Cersei\'s relationship begins to crumble to the ground. Jaime\'s imprisonement and relationship with Brienne has influenced Jaime quite significantly. Tywin procures a Valyrian steel sword for Jaime, the twin of <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Widow%27s_Wail\" title=\"Widow\'s Wail\">another sword</a> forged from <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Ice\" title=\"Ice\">Ice</a>, but Jaime is only angered because his once-unparalleled skill has been taken from him. Father and son argue ferociously when Jaime refuses to resign from the Kingsguard and become the future Lord of Casterly Rock, leading to Tywin disowning Jaime. Jaime later calls a meeting in the White Sword Tower to analyse his Sworn Brothers and enforce the duties of the white cloak on them.\n</p>\n<p>Jaime gives the Valyrian steel blade to Brienne, naming it Oathkeeper and tasking her with finding Sansa Stark. He provides her with gold, a horse and armour of her own, along with a letter sealed by King Tommen as she will be doing the king\'s service. When Tyrion is accused of Joffrey\'s murder, and both his conventional trial and his trial by combat end disastrously, Jaime is convinced of his brother\'s innocence. He ambushes Lord Varys and demands his aid in freeing Tyrion. During the escape, Jaime confesses to Tyrion about the incident between Tyrion and Tysha years ago - that she was not a whore, and that hse loved Tyrion. Shocked, awed and furious at this, Tyrion hits him and falsely claims responsibility for his murder. During this showdown, Tyrion tells his brother that Cersei has betrayed him repeatedly with Ser Lancel Lannister and Osmund Kettleblack. Jaime leaves, therefore not seeing Tyrion sneak into the Tower of the Hand and murder their father with a crossbow.\n</p>\n<p>Ser Jaime is amongst those contacted after <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Tywin_Lannister\" title=\"Tywin Lannister\">Tywin Lannister</a> is found dead. Jaime climbs down the shaft to investigate the secret passages, and Cersei laments sending the crippled Jaime.

He has a very consistent habit of referring to himself in the third person when addressing other people, as if he were a man of supreme importance. An unapologetic sycophant, Janos also claims to work in the best interests of people who are already in power, in spite of the fact that most such men despise him for this reason - he works often of his own accord, in defiance of decency or even his own orders. Janos has accepted bribes and misusing promotions and positions within the City Watch.\n</p>\n<p>Glutted with power and too easily enjoying it, Janos is capable of being freely immoral and even cruel when it suits him. He also believes savagery committed by his hand or under his authority to be bravery, which he shows no complaint in stating when discussing the matter of a slaughter in Chataya\'s Brothel. When he is sent to Castle Black, his ineptitude only flares up, as he makes illogical and selfish decisions and claims throughout his tenure, and shows no respect or gratitude to men who truly deserve it. He is disrespectful of good and true men like Donal Noye, and especially Jon Snow, whom he labels corrupt and deceitful based simply on the fact that he\'s a bastard, ignoring that he was from far lower beginnings than the boy. Even after being stripped of his ranks and sent to the Wall, he flaunts the title of Lord of Harrenhal, despite it changing hands at least twice after he was dismissed.\n</p>\n<p>Janos\' arrogance has proven to be his downfall. Even after Jon Snow is elected Lord Commander of the Night\'s Watch, Slynt defies and disrespects him at every opportunity he gets. When Jon gives him an explicit command, Janos claims impunity to disobey orders that don\'t suit him. Only when he is at the point of a sword does he plead for forgiveness that he doesn\'t deserve.\n</p>\n<p>Eddard Stark was named Lord Regent of the Seven Kingdoms by King Robert in a proclamation (until his heir comes of age).

As a reward he is given the high lordship of Harrenhal by Cersei Lannister. \n</p>\n<p>Cersei orders Slynt to have the Gold cloaks kill all of Robert Baratheon\'s bastard children. Partly because people looking at them can perceive that her own children are not Robert\'s heirs, but also to get back at Robert.

He is building support and seems destined to win. <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Samwell_Tarly\" title=\"Samwell Tarly\">Samwell Tarly</a> is very anxious that this not occur, as Slynt expressed the wish to punish Jon Snow for desertion and murder.

Jon orders him to take a group of Night Watch men and wildlings to one of the abandoned castles at the Wall to restore and open it. Jon gives him the night to reconsider his refusal. The next day, he is going to have Slynt imprisoned, but realizes that Janos will always make trouble and must be an example.

He was not especially skilled at combat, despite much practice. Whilst handsome, he often adopted a sneering expression which rendered him less attractive. He always dressed in fine clothes and wielded weapons of extravagant and boisterous names. Despite him allegedly being a Baratheon, he (very ironically) completely favoured the colours of his mother\'s house. Joffrey was also likened by others more to a lion than a stag - a reflection that he held more Lannister pride than he did Baratheon strength.\n</p>\n<p>Joffrey was vain, arrogant, barely-educated, ignorant in many key areas and believed that force was the answer to every problem - in fact, aggression, violence and bloodlust was his trigger reaction to any threat that approached him. Despite being, at best, a decent swordsman in friendly matches, Joffrey was not a great warrior nor a commander of men, even though he staunchly believed himself to be both of these things. Joffrey never fought his own battles if he could afford it, relying almost completely on bodyguards or warriors at his disposal, or on the authority he inherited (unjustly) as king.\n</p>\n<p>An almost laughably stupid boy with a slow wit and a narrow mind, he was altogether ignorant of the niceties and subtleties of politics, never making dominantly political decisions that had either merit or logical meaning. He could be polite and correct in behaviour when necessary, but generally only when cajoled into doing so by his family. As he grew older, his behaviour became more and more erratic, a fact noticed by many around him, including his grandfather and Hand, Tywin, who several times had to rebuke his grandson\'s behavior in public It could be speculated that Joffrey\'s sense of decorum washed away completely when a crown was placed on his head. Joffrey was a boy who never learned to curb his tongue, resorting immediately to the offensive and completely ignoring the concept of decency when it suited him. Joffrey has no sense of respect, and openly accuses Tywin Lannister of cowardice during Robert\'s Rebellion, even though Tywin\'s monstrous actions had won Robert the throne (and Robert was supposed to be Joffrey\'s father).\n</p>\n<p>A psychopath who was obsessed with the self-conception of greatness, power and authority, Joffrey never truly behaved like a king, rather a spoiled child with a crown on his head who has too much power for his own good. He was a poor ruler based solely on the fact that he worsened the predicament of his kingdoms by making decisions that served his own enjoyment. He hated his people, having contempt for lords and commoners alike, and heatedly ordered the massacre of people <i>in his own city</i> when they threw dung at him. Joffrey was hated and feared by his siblings, loathed by his uncle Tyrion and even his own biological father Jaime, who believed he deserved to die.\n</p>\n<p>Joffrey was born to Queen <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Cersei_Lannister\" title=\"Cersei Lannister\">Cersei Lannister</a> and presented to the world as the son of King <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Robert_Baratheon\" title=\"Robert Baratheon\">Robert Baratheon</a>. In truth, Joffrey was conceived from an incestuous relationship between Queen Cersei and her brother, Ser <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Jaime_Lannister\" title=\"Jaime Lannister\">Jaime Lannister</a>, the Kingslayer.\n</p>\n<p>Joffrey grew up as a spoiled and indulged child, doted on by his mother. Despite this, Joffrey came to idolise Robert, vowing to become as great a warrior.\n</p>\n<p>Despite this desire to emulate Robert, Joffrey had a cruel streak within him. After learning a castle cat was pregnant, he killed the animal and cut open its belly to investigate further. Proud of his discovery, he brought his findings to Robert who then beat him bloody. Afterwards he had little to do with Joffrey, and Joffrey grew up further sheltered and indulged by his mother, who assigned <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Sandor_Clegane\" title=\"Sandor Clegane\">Sandor Clegane</a>, \'the Hound\', to him as a bodyguard and sworn sword.\n</p>\n<p>Joffrey rides to <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Winterfell\" title=\"Winterfell\">Winterfell</a> with his father and mother.

He has the second most chapters total in all of the books.\n</p>\n<p>Jon is said to have more of the north in him and resembles his father Eddard more than his half-brothers, who have inherited Tully features from Catelyn. <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Tyrion_Lannister\" title=\"Tyrion Lannister\">Tyrion Lannister</a> observes that Jon has the traditional Stark features in all but the family name. Even at age 14, Jon is lean with dark brown hair and grey eyes so dark they border on black. Many people are able to identify Jon is of Stark blood just by looking at him. Out of all his half-siblings, only <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Arya_Stark\" title=\"Arya Stark\">Arya Stark</a> and Jon have inherited the traditional Stark look.\n</p>\n<p>Jon was raised by his father Eddard Stark alongside his brothers and sisters to know the ways of honor and duty, and possesses a strong moral compass. He is close with his father and half-siblings, especially Arya and Robb. Jon idolizes his father but is wounded by Eddard\'s refusal to identify who Jon\'s mother is, who Eddard will not speak about for mysterious reasons. Eddard\'s wife Catelyn resents Eddard bringing Jon to Winterfell to raise himself. As a result, Catelyn disdains Jon and treats him coldly. As a result of his illegitimacy, Jon feels like somewhat of an outsider in his family and matured faster than his siblings.\n</p>\n<p>Jon is proven to be highly skilled in combat, especially with a sword. He is able to match Qhorin Halfhand during their duel, although the man planned to die at Jon\'s hands anyway. He could also match Robb Stark, reportedly, in sword combat. He is a natural leader, which he proves early on in his time at the Night\'s Watch, and he took on a crucial role in the Battle of Castle Black.\n</p>\n<p>Jon Snow was raised among Lord Eddard\'s trueborn children. He has a half-brother named Robb, who is slightly older than him, two younger half-sisters named Sansa and Arya, and two younger half-brothers named Bran and Rickon. When Jon was an infant, Eddard brought him back from the war to raise at Winterfell, much to the distress of his wife Catelyn who had recently given birth to Robb at Riverrun. Eddard often mentored Robb and Jon, who are of the same age, and they were trained together by Ser Rodrik, Winterfell\'s master-at-arms. Jon was also educated by Maester Luwin alongside with the other Stark children. While Jon loves all of his half-siblings, he has especially strong bonds with Robb and Arya. He views Robb as his, \"his rival and best friend and constant companion,” and they often played and trained together as young boys. Jon is closest with Arya, who “never seemed to fit, no more than he had... yet she could always make Jon smile.\"\n</p>\n<p>King Robert Baratheon and the royal party come to Winterfell. Though Jon usually sits with his family, he must sit with the squires during this feast. He drinks more than he is used to (at dinner at his father\'s table, he is only allowed one cup of wine). Eddard\'s brother, Benjen, arrives at the feast. Benjen is First Ranger in the Night\'s Watch. As with his father, Jon looks up to his uncle and tells Benjen he wants to join the Night\'s Watch, pleading with this uncle to convince his father to let him join. Jon is upset when Benjen tells him to wait a few years and father bastards of his own first. Jon shouts that he doesn\'t want that and runs from the hall in tears. Outside, he meets Tyrion Lannister, who is an outsider in his own way as a dwarf. He tells Jon to never forget who he is and wear his bastardy like armor so it can never be used to hurt him.\n</p>\n<p>When Lord Eddard is to go to King\'s Landing to be Hand of the King, he must hastily make plans for his children. Eddard wants Jon to stay at Winterfell with Robb, but Catelyn will not have him stay at Winterfell if Eddard goes, telling Eddard that Jon is his son, not hers. Eddard becomes angry with Catelyn, fearing Jon will be shunned in the King\'s Landing court due to his bastard\'s name. As Eddard becomes angrier with Catelyn over her refusal to let Jon stay at Winterfell, Maester Luwin interrupts and tells them that Jon had expressed a wish to take the black. Catelyn is pleased while Eddard is shocked and has reservations about letting Jon go. Maester Luwin convinces Eddard to allow it as these are hard times for them all, \"His road is no crueler than yours or your lady’s.\" Eddard reflects for a while, acknowledging that bastard-born individuals can rise high in the Night\'s Watch and the Night\'s Watch is an honorable and noble calling, but is still hesitant. Catelyn thinks that Jon can be like a son to Benjen in the Watch and parallels having to let go of three of her children with Eddard having to let go of Jon. Though unhappy, Eddard dispiritedly decides to allow it and will talk to Benjen and Jon. In her thoughts, Catelyn is pleased as this means any possible children Jon may have had will never be rivals to her own grandchildren for the inheritance of Winterfell.\n</p>\n<p>As the Stark family prepares to leave, with Eddard, Arya, and Sansa going south, and Benjen and Jon going north, Jon says his farewells to his siblings. He has a tearful good-bye with a now comatose Bran, who had fallen from a tower. Jon begs Bran not to die. He has a warm good-bye with Robb, making plans to see each other at Castle Black. Then Jon has an emotional farewell with Arya. He gives her a sword he had made for her. When he arrives at Castle Black, Jon is disappointed to find that the Night\'s Watch is no longer what it once was, having fallen into disrepair and ruin. Though there are ex-knights, nobleborn second sons, and highborn bastard sons still among its ranks, many of its ranks are now staffed by ex-criminals and misfits who took the black to escape execution. The master of arms is Ser Alliser Thorne who takes an instant dislike to Jon. Ser Alliser was sent to the Wall after Robert\'s Rebellion. It was that or death, so he hates Jon for who his father is and mocks him as \'Lord Snow\' for being an illegitimate son with a young lord\'s upbringing. Jon easily defeats the other recruits in training practice, though they are older and bigger than him. However, <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Donal_Noye\" title=\"Donal Noye\">Donal Noye</a>, a blacksmith who works in the armory, shames Jon for this. He opens Jon\'s eyes when he points out to Jon that he has had advantages the others have not had: Jon was raised in a castle with a highborn upbringing and was trained under a master-at-arms his whole life while the other boys did not come from privileged circumstances and have never even held a sword before. Noye warns Jon that if he keeps going down this route, he will make enemies. This forces Jon to realize the rough circumstances the other boys grew up in and he begins training the other recruits himself, earning their respect and friendship.\n</p>\n<p>A new recruit, <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Samwell_Tarly\" title=\"Samwell Tarly\">Samwell Tarly</a>, joins the Watch. Jon learns that despite the fact that Sam is the trueborn heir to <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/House_Tarly\" title=\"House Tarly\">House Tarly</a>, his father disowned him as Sam prefers books and hates hunting and fighting. Jon reaches out to Sam and helps him become friends with the other recruits. When Ser Alliser wants to bully and have the soft, bookish, non-combative Sam beaten in training, Jon works to protect Sam and arranges for the other recruits to go easy on Sam. When Jon and the other recruits pass training and are allowed to take their vows, Sam has still not passed training. Jon fears that it will only be a matter of time before Sam is hurt or killed under Ser Alliser\'s training. He convinces Maester Aemon to take Sam on as his steward instead, pointing out Sam\'s intelligence and high level of reading and writing. Later, after saving Lord Commander Mormont\'s life from a wight, Mormont gives Jon his ancestral sword, Longclaw, as a reward. Mormont had the pommel changed from a bear the head of a white direwolf with garnet red eyes. Jon is touched but feels conflicted over accepting the sword. Mormont insists he take it.\n</p>\n<p>When news arrives first of Lord Eddard\'s arrest, Jon is devastated and overcome with worry for his father and sisters. When Jon learns of his father\'s execution, he is overwhelmed with grief and decides to desert to go and join Robb\'s army. He is followed by his friends and persuaded to return to Castle Black, to keep his vow to the Night\'s Watch. Ser Jeor Mormont knows he tried to leave, but understands why he did it as it was out of love for his family, and tells Jon, \"You have not deserted—yet. Here you stand. If we beheaded every boy who rode to Mole’s Town in the night, only ghosts would guard the Wall.\" He forces Jon to realize there is nothing he can do to bring his father back and fighting by Robb\'s side will not bring Eddard back from the dead. He explains to Jon how those wars in the south over a throne are nothing compared to what is stirring beyond the Wall, \"I will not sit here meekly and wait for the snows and the ice winds. We must know what is happening. This time the Night’s Watch will ride in force, against the King-beyond-the-Wall, the Others, and anything else that may be out there. I mean to command them myself (...) So I will have an answer from you, Lord Snow, and I will have it now. Are you a brother of the Night’s Watch... or only a bastard boy who wants to play at war?” Jon makes his decision and accompanies Mormont beyond the Wall as his squire.\n</p>\n<p>Lord Commander <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Jeor_Mormont\" title=\"Jeor Mormont\">Jeor Mormont</a> leads a ranging beyond the Wall taking 300 men to find Benjen Stark and learn where the Wildlings are going, once and for all. They travel to Craster\'s Keep and beyond to the Fist of the First Men. Jon is chosen to be part of an expedition, his group is lead by the legendary <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Qhorin_Halfhand\" title=\"Qhorin Halfhand\">Qhorin Halfhand</a>. They fight against a small group of Wildlings and Jon kills one of them, but refuses to kill another when he realizes that it is a girl, her name is <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Ygritte\" title=\"Ygritte\">Ygritte</a>. He takes her as a prisoner instead of killing her. When Qhorin Halfhand leaves Jon to execute Ygritte, Jon cannot find it in himself to do so and decides to free her, because he is not able to kill this girl. Later on, the group is discovered by another group of Wildlings, lead by Rattleshirt. Before they can take Qhorin and Jon captured, Qhorin orders Jon to join the Wildlings and find out what their plans are, therefore Jon should do everything to earn their trust. Ygritte is part of Rattleshirt\'s group, too. As part of his plan to have Jon infiltrate the wildlings, Qhorin has Jon kill him in one-on-one combat after the wildlings force them to fight. Ygritte believes that Jon is joined the Wildlings.\n</p>\n<p>While Jon searches for a way to escape, he travels with Ygritte, with whom he falls in love, and the others. Jon finds himself conflicted between his love for Ygritte and sympathy for the wildling\'s plight vs. his duty to the Night\'s Watch. However, he chooses duty over love and remains loyal to the Watch. They manage to scale the Wall. When Jon tries to leave for the Watch, he is unknowingly saved by his brother Bran, who uses his Warging abilities to allow Jon to escape. Barely alive, Jon makes it back to Castle Black and is devastated to hear of the deaths of his younger brothers Bran and Rickon at the hands of his father\'s ward Theon Greyjoy.\n</p>\n<p>At Castle Black, Jon is able to warn the Night\'s Watch of the impending attack. He and Donal Noye mount a defense of Castle Black. Donal is killed in the assault, leaving Jon to dutifully and skillfully lead them to victory, earning the admiration of the Night\'s Watchmen. However, Jon finds Ygritte with an arrow in her chest. Jon goes to her and holds her in his arms, insisting that the maester can save her. However, Ygritte accepts her death and dies in Jon\'s arms, leaving Jon grief-stricken.\n</p>\n<p>However, Jon is immediately arrested upon Janos Slynt and Alliser Thorne\'s arrival, due to his involvement with the wildlings and assassination of Qhorin Halfhand, not believing Jon when he tells them that he was following orders from the Halfhand himself. However, they release him and force him to lead an assassination attempt against Mance Rayder in hopes Jon will be killed himself. However, when Jon meets with Mance, Stannis and his troops arrive before anything can happen.

Janos Slynt attempts to cause uproar amongst the troops by disobeying Jon\'s orders multiple times. Ultimately, Jon doesn\'t put up with this and personally executes Slynt. As Jon is trying to save as many as he can from the Others, including his efforts to save the wildlings, these decisions are met with opposition by Bowen Marsh and his other officers. His efforts to ally with and save the wildlings, as well as the aid he provides to Stannis as Stannis is one of the few supporting the Watch, causes contention between himself and a faction of his men. Toward the end of his last chapter, Jon receives a threatening letter from Ramsay Bolton, resulting in Jon announcing his intention to march south and confront Ramsay. Shortly after, Jon hears a scream of agony and rushes to the source. A bleeding Wun Wun has killed Ser Patrek of King\'s Mountain and as Jon is trying to prevent more loss of life, he is stabbed repeatedly by Bowen Marsh and other black brothers, who attack in tears while muttering \"for the Watch\".

Now older and weathered by her experiences, Lysa has become thick-bodied due to several pregnancies, miscarriages and stillbirths that she has suffered. Even though Catelyn is older than her, Lysa looks like she has aged ten years and has become pale and fat-cheeked, which she tries to remedy with scents, paints and powders. She has an aggressive look to her, with a petulant mouth. She tends to dress in the blue clothes of her husband\'s house.\n</p>\n<p>While Lysa had been sweet and kind, if shy and nervous and delicate as a girl, tending towards fits of giggles and nervous silences, she has become both hardened and complicated as a result of her life in King\'s Landing. A number of people in the Crownlands have low and demeaning opinions of her, thinking her to be eccentric, frail of mind and petulant. Men like Grand Maester Pycelle describe her as \'undisciplined\', and claims that she sees enemies in every shadow. There is some truth in this, since Lysa was excruciatingly paranoid and fearful to an extreme about those who surround her. She had a cold and uneven opinion of her bannermen and supporters, and those of her husband, thinking of them as vultures who are trying to pick her world apart - in fact, she saw almost everyone in this regard.\n</p>\n<p>Lysa is supremely, almost dangerously protective of Robert, her only surviving child, and will go to extreme measures to protect him and keep him close - even though she did not love Robert\'s father. Lysa has developed an intense hatred of her remaining family, going so far as to threaten her own sister upon the suggestion that her son be fostered and refusing to take part in the War of the Five Kings despite the violent effect it has had on her family. She is quick to anger, and temperamental, sentencing Tyrion Lannister to death on the grounds of personal prejudice and rather thin evidence. She has spoiled her son his entire life, but her obsession with him has gone to such an extent that she breastfed him for an unnaturally long time.\n</p>\n<p>When Sansa finally meets Lysa, she realises that the woman has become effectively insane, prone to ferocious mood swings and fits of rage and hysteria. She treats Sansa, her own blood, extremely cruelly and gives her no respect. Her main weakness is the fact that she is obsessively in love with Petyr Baelish, and has been since she was a girl - her blind love allows him to easily manipulate her into murdering her own husband and bringing chaos to her family. She was stupid and blind enough to believe that he loved her. This led to Lysa instinctively believing that, when she learns of Petyr kissing Sansa, she interprets it in reverse and believes that Sansa is trying to steal him from her. This led to her completely losing her mind and outright physically threatening to throw Sansa through the Moon Door. She reveals herself to be blind of the following - that Petyr doesn\'t love her (hence kissing Sansa, whom he sees as an extension of Catelyn), and never had (since Petyr has been obsessed with Catelyn his whole life and, even when she gave him her maidenhead, he called her by her sister\'s name) and that Petyr is far more dangerous than she could have possibly imagined (since he managed to exploit her so easily).\n</p>\n<p>She grew up with Catelyn at <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Riverrun\" title=\"Riverrun\">Riverrun</a>, where she fell in love with <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Petyr_Baelish\" title=\"Petyr Baelish\">Petyr Baelish</a>. When the girls grew older, Lysa went to a drunk Petyr and had sex with him. He thought she was Catelyn. Baelish is thrown out when a pregnant Lysa went to her father and asked to marry him. Instead her father married her to <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Jon_Arryn\" title=\"Jon Arryn\">Jon Arryn</a> of the <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Eyrie\" title=\"Eyrie\">Eyrie</a>, a man old enough to be her grandfather and the keeper of the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Vale\" title=\"Vale\">Vale</a> of Arryn. Lysa\'s father, <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Hoster_Tully\" title=\"Hoster Tully\">Hoster Tully</a> made marriage to a soiled Lysa as the price of the <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Riverrun\" title=\"Riverrun\">Riverrun</a> alliance and troops for Robert\'s Rebellion. Lysa believed that marriage would give her child a name, but her father gave her a potion to cause a miscarriage. This maybe why she is so obsessive a mother, and she has never forgiven her father. Lysa had many miscarriages and only gave Jon Arryn one son, <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Robert_Arryn\" title=\"Robert Arryn\">Robert Arryn</a>, who is a sickly child. After Jon Arryn died in <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/King%27s_Landing\" title=\"King\'s Landing\">King\'s Landing</a>, Lysa took Robert and fled to the Eyrie, where she has been cowering since.\n</p>\n<p>Lysa sent a message secretly to Catelyn Stark (it was in a coded message hidden in the false bottom of a box left in the chamber of <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Maester_Luwin\" title=\"Maester Luwin\">Maester Luwin</a> of Winterfell). In the letter she accused the Lannisters of being responsible for her husband\'s death. This was a good part of the reason why Lord <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Eddard_Stark\" title=\"Eddard Stark\">Eddard Stark</a> accepted the position as <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Hand_of_the_King\" title=\"Hand of the King\">Hand of the King</a>, to investigate the plot. There was also the information from Petyr Baelish that the knife used in the assassination attempt on Bran, was owned by <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Tyrion_Lannister\" title=\"Tyrion Lannister\">Tyrion Lannister</a>. These facts culminated in Catelyn Stark taking Tyrion Lannister prisoner and putting him on trial, which began the first fighting in the <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/War_of_the_Five_Kings\" title=\"War of the Five Kings\">War of the Five Kings</a>. She has refused to send the Eyrie\'s troops to help anyone in this war, though she did nearly execute <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Tyrion_Lannister\" title=\"Tyrion Lannister\">Tyrion Lannister</a> when Catelyn brought him to her as a captive.\n</p>\n<p>As a wealthy, still fertile widow, with only a sickly child, Lysa is seen as a very eligible match by all her bannermen. Since the death of her husband she has been continually surrounded by suitors, try to court her favor.

At the Eyrie, Sansa learns that Petyr convinced Lysa that he was in love with her, so she murdered Jon Arryn herself.

As many younger sons did, he trained as a knight and seems to have been an effective warrior, although slightly unusual for favouring a mace over the sword in combat. Maekar was already a grown man when the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Blackfyre_Rebellion\" title=\"Blackfyre Rebellion\">Blackfyre Rebellion</a> erupted and led troops in the <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Battle_of_Redgrass_Field\" title=\"Battle of Redgrass Field\">Battle of Redgrass Field</a> against the forces of the usurper, <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Daemon_Blackfyre\" title=\"Daemon Blackfyre\">Daemon Blackfyre</a>.

Maekar was unimpressed when his eldest son, <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Daeron_Targaryen\" title=\"Daeron Targaryen\">Daeron</a>, absconded to visit a tavern and his youngest, <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Aegon_V_Targaryen\" title=\"Aegon V Targaryen\">Aegon</a>, temporarily disappeared. His second son, <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Aerion_Targaryen\" title=\"Aerion Targaryen\">Aerion</a>, entered the lists, challenging Ser Humphrey Harding. Ser Humphrey was credited with the victory and given Aerion\'s destrier as recompense for his own horse, which was slain, most believe deliberately, by Aerion in the joust. Angered, Aerion later attacked a Dornish puppeteer, Tanselle Too Tall, for depicting a fight between knights and a dragon in which the dragon was killed, claiming it was an insult against House Targaryen. When a <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Hedge_knight\" title=\"Hedge knight\">hedge knight</a> named Ser <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Duncan_the_Tall\" title=\"Duncan the Tall\">Duncan the Tall</a> intervened and injured the prince, the result was a call for single combat.

Maekar joined with his sons and ordered three members of the Kings\' Guard to do so as well. To Maekar\'s astonishment and fury, his brother Baelor took Duncan\'s side, and fought as one of his seven. During the fight that followed Maekar\'s mace damaged Baelor\'s helmet, but Maekar was nevertheless overcome and Duncan\'s team proved victorious. When the battle was over and the fighters\' armour was removed, Baelor was revealed to have suffered catastrophic head wounds, and died almost immediately.\n</p>\n<p>Maekar felt sickened and shamed by the accidental killing of his brother. Aware of Aerion\'s deficiencies, he sent him to the <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Free_Cities\" title=\"Free Cities\">Free Cities</a> for \'seasoning\'. His youngest son, Aegon, had served as Ser Duncan\'s squire before and during the Trial of Seven and refused to squire for any other knight. Maekar was astounded when Ser Duncan rejected his offer of service at Summerhall and agreed to accept Aegon (Egg) only if he could take him on the road. Given the failings of his two oldest sons, Maekar did acceed to Ser Duncan\'s terms in the hope that doing without royal priviledges would make his youngest son a better man.\n</p>\n<p>When the <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Great_Spring_Sickness\" title=\"Great Spring Sickness\">Great Spring Sickness</a> killed his father, Maekar\'s brother <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Aerys_I_Targaryen\" title=\"Aerys I Targaryen\">Aerys</a> took the throne.

Maekar went and \'sulked\' at the Targaryen summer palace of <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Summerhall\" title=\"Summerhall\">Summerhall</a> for most of the next ten years.\n</p>\n<p>When Aerys I died without issue, Maekar became king. He disliked Bloodraven and did not permit him to carry on as Hand. Maekar never wanted the throne, according to Maester Aemon.\n</p>\n<p>Maekar\'s reign was effective but ridden by disappointments and failings. Maekar\'s eldest son Daeron died of a pox caught from a whore, whilst the increasingly mad Aerion tried to turn himself into a <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Dragons\" title=\"Dragons\">Dragons</a> by drinking <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Wildfire\" title=\"Wildfire\">wildfire</a> and instead died. Maekar\'s third son <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Aemon_Targaryen_(Maester)\" title=\"Aemon Targaryen (Maester)\">Aemon</a> had become a <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Maester\" title=\"Maester\">maester</a> of the <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Citadel\" title=\"Citadel\">Citadel</a>, thus removing himself from the succession. Maekar himself died in 233 whilst fighting an outlaw lord. He was succeeded by his youngest son Aegon.\n</p>\n<p>Maekar\'s death left a void on the throne, and for the first and last time during the reign of the Targaryens, a <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Great_Council\" title=\"Great Council\">Great Council</a> was convened to find a successor. Daeron\'s feeble-witted daughter and Aerion\'s infant son were dismissed due to concerns about incompetence and potential madness respectively. The crown was offered to Aemon, but he turned it down and not only retained his role as a maester but removed himself to the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Wall\" title=\"Wall\">Wall</a> and joined the <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Night%27s_Watch\" title=\"Night\'s Watch\">Night\'s Watch</a>, effectively preventing him from taking the crown twice over. Finally, Maekar\'s youngest son Aegon took the crown, becoming Aegon V Targaryen.\n</p>\n<p>Maekar was a strong warrior. He was highly skilled at arms, but spent his life somewhat in the shadow of his eldest brother Baelor, who was strong and more accomplished at arms. He was handsome, with an impressive beard and moustache and the trademark purple eyes and silver-gold hair of the Targaryens. Maekar preferred to use a spiked mace in combat and typically wore black armour emblazoned with his personal crest (the Targaryen triple-headed dragon repeated four times, two above and two below). Maekar wore a new crown, black iron and red gold, sharply pointed.\n</p>\n<p>Maekar was not as well loved as his older brother Baelor, in whose shadow he seemed irreparably dwarfed: the prince was often perceived as cold, bitter and harsh, whilst Baelor was noble, even-tempered and very popular. A stern and critical man and a hard father, Maekar lacked the easy charisma of Prince Baelor, and after he mortally wounded his brother in single combat he was haunted by the concept that he had effectively killed him until the end of his days - a fact which he acknowledged early on, but nevertheless it made him more merciless and cold.\n</p>\n<p>However, Maekar has his own sense of honour and did not begrudge Ser Duncan the Tall for his major involvement in what led up to Baelor\'s death, and allowed for his youngest son Aegon to be the man\'s squire, though he expressed shock and awe at the idea of a prince of the realm serving a hedge knight until Duncan pointed out both Aerion and Daeron\'s shortcomings. He also saw fit to send Aerion, who had ultimately started the whole incident, to the Free Cities after the trial. He was a courageous man who survived many battles and fought on the front line even when he became king.\n</p>\n<p>Maekar was haunted for the rest of his life by Baelor\'s death, with his son Aemon describing how he felt that the Iron Throne was \'<i>punishment for the blow that slew his brother</i>\'.\n</p>\n<p>Maekar appears in <i><a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/The_Hedge_Knight\" title=\"The Hedge Knight\">The Hedge Knight</a></i>, which depicts the tourney where his brother died.\n</p>','http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Maekar_I_Targaryen',NULL,NULL,NULL),(557,'Maelor Targaryen',1,0,NULL,'<p><b>Maelor Targaryen</b> was the second son of King <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Aegon_II_Targaryen\" title=\"Aegon II Targaryen\">Aegon II Targaryen</a> and Queen <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Helaena_Targaryen\" title=\"Helaena Targaryen\">Helaena Targaryen</a>.

Oberyn was also able to work with his brother on their pact with the surviving Targaryens, and his visit to King\'s Landing was meant to get the measure of the enemies of Dorne - Oberyn\'s treasured revenge is still carried on in his remaining family, who loved him and wished to avenge his brutal death.\n</p>\n<p><i>To Be Added</i>\n</p>\n<p>He rides to Kings Landing to attend the wedding of King Joffrey, but also seek justice for his murdered family members.

So Oberyn decides to act as champion of <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Tyrion_Lannister\" title=\"Tyrion Lannister\">Tyrion Lannister</a> against Ser Gregor in hopes to attain the revenge he yearns. At the trial, a brutal duel begins, in which Oberyn wields a spear to counter the arm span of Gregor and his own speed to counter the Mountain\'s ferocity. Although the Mountain claims not to recognise oberyn or know of Elia and her children, Oberyn relentlessly shouts \"Elia of Dorne you raped her, you murdered her. You killed her children\", infuriating his enemy. After wearing down the Mountain and repeatedly wounding him, he goes in for the kill and stabs Ser Gregor through the chest, but as he stands over him and continues to demand a confession from Gregor, the Mountain pulls him down, tells him how he murdered Elia, then bashes his skull in with his fist. As his spear is poisoned, the Mountain dies.\n</p>','https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Oberyn_Martell','Oberyn_Martell.jpeg',104,7),(644,'Old Nan',0,0,NULL,'<p><strong class=\"selflink\">Old Nan</strong> is a caregiver of the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Stark\" title=\"Stark\">Stark</a> children, best known for telling stories.\n</p>\n<p>Old Nan is described as very old (she is the great-grandmother of <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Hodor\" title=\"Hodor\">Hodor</a>) and appears to have an especially close relationship with <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Bran_Stark\" title=\"Bran Stark\">Bran Stark</a>.

He always has the scent of mint on his breath. He tends to dress in black and his personal sigil is a silver mockingbird, as opposed to the Titan of Braavos that emblazons his family\'s flag.\n</p>\n<p>Highly intelligent and ambitious, Petyr is well known for being extremely cunning and Machiavellian, and has been so his entire life. On account of the fact that he was born to an incredibly lowly house in the Vale, his father was a foreigner and he has a track record with several great lords (namely the Starks, Tullys and Lannisters), nobody truly trusts him, but too many people make the mistake of eventually bowing to his silver tongue. Eddard Stark was among these people, even though Petyr cheerfully admitted that trusting him was a mistake. Even though Petyr comes from a low background, he is a better politician, schemer and mastermind than almost any other lord in Westeros - the possible exceptions include Varys and Tywin Lannister, but Petyr matches them with his serene ruthlessness and unpredictability.\n</p>\n<p>Whether or not Petyr is an inherently evil man is debatable to say the least: he admits that he has always loved Catelyn Stark, and fought an almost fatal duel against Brandon Stark for her hand. When Catelyn was killed by the Freys in the Red Wedding, Petyr vengefully murdered Joffrey Baratheon at his own wedding, scheming with the fearsome Olenna Tyrell to do so. He is actually rather fearless, personally confronting the Lords Declarant whom he knew were dangerous and intent on destroying him, and playing perilous games with powerful men and women, over whom he is completely confident in his advantage. However, even these factors lead to weaknesses: Petyr may have loved Cat, but this love changed perversely when he kissed Sansa Stark and started being overtly intimate with her (which was publicly excused with the shared lie that he was her father, while she hid in the Vale).\n</p>\n<p>He has a rather dry sense of humour, which he often uses to make himself seem passive and obsequious, a mask for how dangerous a man he is. One thing that many people who work professionally with him recognise that he has an almost effortless knack for creating networks of his own, in regards to loans, transactions, espionage and even developing relationships with other people to develop his own advantages. He has served ably as master-of-coin, proving his brilliance, perseverance and fierce ambition.\n</p>\n<p>Petyr has no qualms about breaking sacred laws such as that of marriage, since he murdered Lysa Arryn when she threatened to expose the shared plan of murdering Jon Arryn. Petyr appears not to notice that his schemes of murder and corruption, betraying and applying to the deaths of Jon Arryn and Eddard Stark, have led almost inevitably to the death of the woman he loved, and the obliteration of her family. His catharsis from Catelyn\'s murder was simply to murder Joffrey, which resulted in even further dismay from the killings that followed the Purple Wedding. Therefore, it is clear that Petyr, for all his motivations, is a dangerous man to cross.\n</p>\n<p>He grew up poor in <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Riverrun\" title=\"Riverrun\">Riverrun </a> with <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Catelyn_Stark\" title=\"Catelyn Stark\">Catelyn Stark</a> and <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Lysa_Arryn\" title=\"Lysa Arryn\">Lysa Arryn</a>, and fell in love with Catelyn there, while Lysa fell in love with him.

He enjoys rape, torture, and mutilation, particularly flaying his enemies, a trademark Bolton method that\'s even displayed on the Bolton banner. Ramsay also likes to hunt women, tracking them down, raping and killing them. He names his dogs after the ones who give good chase.\n</p>\n<p>Ramsay is also extremely cunning, surviving seemingly insurmountable odds by tricking his opponents (and even friends). He has a knack for concocting clever, devious and often sadistic traps for people he preys upon, and enjoys hunting other creatures immensely. He is not considered to be a great warrior, his only advantage in combat being his strength and savage nature. Both his father and Theon Greyjoy regard Ramsay as fearless, but his father does not consider it to be a good thing as fear keeps a man alive. \n</p>\n<p>Ramsay Snow is the product of rape. His father, Roose Bolton, raped his mother under the swinging corpse of her husband whom he had just ordered hanged on a pretext. It is possible that Ramsay poisoned Roose\'s legitimate heir, which is what Roose suspects. Roose never fully abandoned the child, and even provided for him, mostly from a distance. As a child, Ramsay had a friend that smelled awful all the time, thus the name <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Reek\" title=\"Reek\">Reek</a>. The Reek that Theon meets is inferred to be Ramsay, assuming the Reek persona. \n</p>\n<p>Ramsay becomes a known and feared force throughout the North, building up his forces and causing widespread pain and suffering until Rodrik Cassel manages to catch him. However, Ramsay disguises himself as Reek and allows Reek to be killed in his place as he is taken to <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Winterfell\" title=\"Winterfell\">Winterfell</a> as a prisoner, where he falsely swears fealty to Theon Greyjoy, who has recently taken it.\n</p>\n<p>It is Ramsay/<a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Reek\" title=\"Reek\">Reek</a> \'s idea to burn the boys at the mill and pass them off as <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Bran_Stark\" title=\"Bran Stark\">Bran</a> and <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Rickon_Stark\" title=\"Rickon Stark\">Rickon Stark</a>, handling their flayings and getting rid of all parties who could have revealed the truth.\n</p>\n<p>When a host was coming to take Wintefell from Theon, Reek told him he could gather men and ride back to defend.\n</p>\n<p>He betrays Theon when he returns to Winterfell with an army posing as allies, only to cut down all the Ironmen, burn Winterfell, and take Theon hostage.\n</p>\n<p>Ramsay keeps Theon as a prisoner, flaying him and sending his flesh to <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Robb_Stark\" title=\"Robb Stark\">Robb Stark</a> as a sign of alliance. However, this alliance would end when Roose murders Robb and ends the Stark campaign. King Tommen declares Ramsay a true Bolton, and he is set to marry \"Arya Stark\", who is actually <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Jeyne_Poole\" title=\"Jeyne Poole\">Jeyne Poole</a>, a friend of Sansa\'s from Winterfell.\n</p>\n<p>Theon has suffered greatly at the hands of Ramsay, now adopting the title Reek and acting as Ramsay\'s personal plaything with a status just below the dogs.\n</p>\n<p>Ramsay takes hold of the North firmly, including the once contended <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Moat_Cailin\" title=\"Moat Cailin\">Moat Cailin</a>, using Theon as an envoy and tricking the ironborn into surrender. Ultimately, all ironborn who surrender are flayed.\n</p>\n<p>He finally marries <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Jeyne_Poole\" title=\"Jeyne Poole\">Jeyne Poole</a> under the ruse that she is Arya Stark in order to lay claim to being lord of the north. In the final chapters of book five, Theon and Jeyne escape Ramsay and are delivered to Stannis, where Theon regains his sense of self as he is reunited with his sister, who is a captive of Stannis.\n</p>','https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Ramsay_Bolton','Ramsay_Snow.jpeg',26,18),(712,'Randyll Tarly',1,1,'A legendary soldier, Randyll Tarly has no patience for his son Samwell?s studious nature.

He protected and supported Brienne of Tarth when he met her and allowed her into his Kingsguard despite the protests of his male supporters, who considered her ugly and foolish. Renly was a skilled politician and could easily attract loyalty on his own, but he is unaccustomed to combat and war, which sets him apart completely from his brothers, who are respectively a great warrior and an experienced commander. Renly was mourned deeply by his lover Loras Tyrell, who joined Joffrey\'s Kingsguard so that he would never marry anyone after Renly\'s death due to the vows of the white cloak. \n</p>\n<p>Renly, much like his lover Loras Tyrell and his fellow king Robb Stark, suffered the unfortunate weakness of being young to war. He was nine years old during Robert\'s Rebellion, and it is not noted that he fought in a war before his brother\'s death. While he was able to summon a mighty force to his banner, he rather misused it by staging a great tourney <i>during the war</i>, running the risk of damaging or even killing great warriors and assets in the process. He also disregarded that Stannis was his elder brother and, regarding the illegitimacy of Cersei\'s children, the true heir, thinking that Stannis was unfit based on the fact that he was respected but not loved. He also did not fault himself for abandoning Ned Stark to the mercy of the Lannisters after Stark refused to support his claim, not accounting for the fact that he still could have aided Ned regardless in order to overthrow Cersei, and been given great respect by Stannis as a result. Catelyn notes that, in great spite of his charisma, Renly has overlooked so many factors in his bid for the Iron Throne. \n</p>\n<p>Renly is homosexual, despite the amount of attention he receives from highborn females. He disdains from book learning, believing that only maesters should read. He does, however, possess some books with \"drawings that would turn a septon blind\", implying some form of pornography.\n</p>\n<p>Renly was born in 277 AC to Lord <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Steffon_Baratheon\" title=\"Steffon Baratheon\">Steffon Baratheon</a> and <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Cassana_Estermont\" title=\"Cassana Estermont\">Cassana Estermont</a>.

He was 7 during <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Robert%27s_Rebellion\" title=\"Robert\'s Rebellion\">Robert\'s Rebellion</a>, and spent the conflict under siege at Storm\'s End with his brother, Stannis.\n</p>\n<p>Renly was granted Storm\'s End by Robert when he left the castle for <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/King%27s_Landing\" title=\"King\'s Landing\">King\'s Landing</a>. This action angered Stannis, who felt that he was the rightful lord. Instead, Stannis was given <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Dragonstone\" title=\"Dragonstone\">Dragonstone</a>.\n</p>\n<p>When he turned 16, Renly partook in a tour of the Stormlands, to celebrate his coming of age. He visited many of his powerful vassals, including <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/House_Tarth\" title=\"House Tarth\">House Tarth</a> of <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Evenfall_Hall\" title=\"Evenfall Hall\">Evenfall Hall</a>, where he danced with <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Brienne_Tarth\" title=\"Brienne Tarth\">Brienne Tarth</a>.

He also participates in the Tourney of the Hand, where he gets defeated by the Hound, Sandor Clegane. \n</p>\n<p>When his brother lies dying, Renly proposes to Eddard to strike when the castle sleeps, wanting to take control. Eddard refuses, and Renly flees King\'s Landing, together with Loras Tyrell.  \n</p>\n<p>Renly later arrives at <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Highgarden\" title=\"Highgarden\">Highgarden</a>, where he marries Margaery Tyrell. \n</p>\n<p>Renly holds a tourney at <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Bitterbridge\" title=\"Bitterbridge\">Bitterbridge when</a> Catelyn arrives, asking for help for Robb.

As a boy he was able to impress the maesters with his wit, and throughout his life he proved himself to be highly intelligent. Rhaegar was also considered to be a talented musician and skilled knight, but was also viewed as a bit melancholy by Ser Barristan and others. He would often visit the ruins of Summerhall with his harp and while returning he\'d always play a sad song of such beauty that it reduced women to tears.\n</p>\n<p>He was an enigmatic man, and there are many mysteries to his actions - why he visited Summerhall, why he chose Lyanna Stark over Elia Martell in the knowledge that she was betrothed, and why he suggested to Jaime Lannister that changes would be made when he returned from the Trident. He was a fierce warrior in his own right and managed to wound Robert during their fateful duel, being dangerous enough an opponent that their duel reached legendary status. Despite this, Rhaegar had been late into combat, and had only decided to take up swordsmanship at all when he read something that persuaded him to do so.\n</p>\n<p>Rhaegar was Aerys\'s II and Rhaella\'s first born son, and was born on 259 AL, on the very same day when the Tragedy at Summerhall took place.

But one day, as Rhaegar was reading some old scrolls, he found something that changed his mind. Though the scroll that he had read is unknown, the next day he went to the Master-at-Arms, Ser Willem Darry, and said <i>\" I will require sword and armor. It seems I must be a warrior.\" </i>Rhaegar would eventually become a capable fighter, distinguishing himself at tournaments and becoming knighted at seventeen years.

After winning another tourney a year later, she and Rhaegar disappeared together, the Starks and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Baratheon\" title=\"Baratheon\">Baratheons</a> believing Rhaegar to have abducted Lyanna.

Rhaenyra, furious over the injustice, proclaimed herself the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms. This proclamation sparked the entire realm to go to war. Some supported Rhaenyra and others Aegon II.

Ser Otto Hightower and Lord Jasper Wylde were executed instead and Aegon disappeared.\n</p>\n<p>When it seemed the war was turning in favor of the Blacks, the sudden betrayal of Hammer and White made her believe all bastards were traitors and ordered the imprisonment of Addam Velaryon and the execution of Nettles. This irrational order made Lord <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Corlys_Velaryon\" title=\"Corlys Velaryon\">Corlys Velaryon</a>, Rhaenyra\'s former father in-law, to release his heir and letting himself be imprisoned, while Lord Manfryd Mooton let Nettles go from Maidenpool and then turned to the Greens.\n</p>\n<p>The important victory at the Tumbleton didn\'t reached Rhaenyra\'s ears in time, and during the Storming of the Dragonpit, her third son Joffrey died trying to climb his mother\'s <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Syrax\" title=\"Syrax\">dragon</a>. The loss of all their current dragons made Rhaenyra flee the capital, taking her (believed to be) last remaining child to Dragonstone, not realizing <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Aegon_II_Targaryen\" title=\"Aegon II Targaryen\">Aegon</a>\'s forces had already taken over the castle.\n</p>\n<p>She was brought to her brother Aegon II, who branded her a traitor of the realm. She was executed by his command. In a grisly and sadistic lesson, he had her body fed to his dragon as her son <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Aegon_III\" title=\"Aegon III\">Aegon III</a> watched.\n</p>\n<p>Rhaenyra had her family\'s Valyrian looks- braided long silver-gold hair and purple eyes. While very beautiful in her youth, six pregnancies took a toll on her figure, becoming a very pudgy and stout woman with an thick waist and a very large bosom. She would always dress lavishly, favoring purple and maroon velvets with intricated patterns. She always wore glittering pearls and diamonds. Rhaenyra also wore her father\'s crown. \n</p>\n<p>Rhaenyra had an arrogant personailty, but at times could be very charming. However, she was quick to anger and never forgot a slight. Despite those defects, she usually listened to the advices of her Small Council, which was in large contrast with her brother Aegon, who usually refused to listen their advices. The other advantage against Aegon was her experience, being raised her whole life as heir made her a very capable ruler, unlike Aegon who was motivated by his mother Alicent Hightower to take the throne. There was only one occasion where she truly quarrelled with her father, and it ended when he threatened to disinherit her, showing that Rhaenyra did, to an extent, enjoy power.\n</p>\n<p>Rhaenyra was reportedly cruel and ruthless when she sat on the Iron Throne, earning the name \'King Maegor with Teats\', and became dangerously paranoid as her very short reign progressed. By the time of her death, Rhaenyra was mad with grief from losing her precious dragon Syrax, so much that she frightened her own son.

Aerys was slain by Ser <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Jaime_Lannister\" title=\"Jaime Lannister\">Jaime Lannister</a> and the city was surrendered to the rebel forces once they arrived.\n</p>\n<p>To ensure there was no threat to Robert\'s line, Lord <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Tywin_Lannister\" title=\"Tywin Lannister\">Tywin Lannister</a> had arranged the deaths of Rhaegar\'s children, which Eddard constituted unjustified murder, leading to a schism between him and Robert that was only healed when they learned of Lyanna\'s death.\n</p>\n<p>It is unclear when Robert decided to claim the Iron Throne directly. Although he had decided that Aerys and Rhaegar had to die for their crimes, it is unknown if the fate of their heirs had similarly been decided. Eddard\'s reaction suggests maybe not.\n</p>\n<p>Robert\'s claim to the Iron Throne was based on the marriage of his grandfather to Princess <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Rhaelle_Targaryen\" title=\"Rhaelle Targaryen\">Rhaelle Targaryen</a>, the daughter of King <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Aegon_V\" title=\"Aegon V\">Aegon V</a>, thus making Robert the legal heir to the <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/House_Targaryen\" title=\"House Targaryen\">Targaryen</a> dynasty if Aerys and all his descendants were killed; however, Robert liked to say that his warhammer was his claim. This gave Robert a much stronger claim to the throne than anyone in the Arryn, Tully or Stark camps. After Aerys and Rhaegar\'s deaths, and with Aerys\' remaining children surrounded and effectively imprisoned on <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Dragonstone\" title=\"Dragonstone\">Dragonstone</a>, the remaining lords of the Seven Kingdoms agreed to swear fealty to Robert and accept him as King.\n</p>\n<p>Robert began his reign by marrying <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Cersei_Lannister\" title=\"Cersei Lannister\">Cersei Lannister</a>, in thanks for Tywin\'s service in delivering the capital to him. Robert had no wish to marry any woman after the death of Lyanna, but Jon Arryn convinced him that a king must have heirs and Cersei Lannister would ensure her father\'s loyalty and the loyalty of <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/House_Lannister\" title=\"House Lannister\">House Lannister</a>. The marriage was not happy, and although Cersei bore three children (<a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Joffrey_Baratheon\" title=\"Joffrey Baratheon\">Joffrey</a>, <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Myrcella_Baratheon\" title=\"Myrcella Baratheon\">Myrcella</a> and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Tommen_Baratheon\" title=\"Tommen Baratheon\">Tommen</a>), Robert was not especially satisfied. He did not like his eldest son and heir Joffrey, beating him once for cutting open a pregnant cat to see what her insides looked like, and in his unhappiness took to drink, feasting and sleeping with other women. In this way he had several bastard children, most notably <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Mya_Stone\" title=\"Mya Stone\">Mya Stone</a>, <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Edric_Storm\" title=\"Edric Storm\">Edric Storm</a> and <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Gendry\" title=\"Gendry\">Gendry</a>, a blacksmith\'s apprentice in the capital.\n</p>\n<p>Robert appointed Lord Jon Arryn as the <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Hand_of_the_King\" title=\"Hand of the King\">Hand of the King</a>, and Jon was an able and effective administrator, repairing relations with <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Dorne\" title=\"Dorne\">Dorne</a> which had turned sour after Lannister bannermen slew Princess <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Elia_Martell\" title=\"Elia Martell\">Elia Martell</a> during the Sack and preventing another war.\n</p>\n<p>Six years after the war, Lord <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Balon_Greyjoy\" title=\"Balon Greyjoy\">Balon Greyjoy</a> of the <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Iron_Islands\" title=\"Iron Islands\">Iron Islands</a> declared independence from the Seven Kingdoms, with the <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Ironborn\" title=\"Ironborn\">ironborn</a> attacking and destroying the Lannister fleet at <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Lannisport\" title=\"Lannisport\">Lannisport</a> and sacking <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Seagard\" title=\"Seagard\">Seagard</a> to forestall any attacks on their territory. Greyjoy believed that Robert\'s response would be weak, as befitting a traitor and usurper, but instead Robert rallied a substantial force and fleet against him. In a pitched battle at <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Pyke\" title=\"Pyke\">Pyke</a> the castle was taken. Both of Balon\'s elder sons died in the war and his youngest, <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Theon_Greyjoy\" title=\"Theon Greyjoy\">Theon</a>, was taken as hostage by Eddard Stark. Balon brought in chains to Robert and was forced to swear fealty once again to the Iron Throne. The swift and brutal repression of the Greyjoy rebellion earned Robert much respect, but this dwindled as he spent far too much of the realm\'s coin on feasting and tourneys. Without an enemy to fight, he went to seed and became noticeably fat and tired.\n</p>\n<p>After the rapid decrease in health of Jon Arryn, which culminates in his death, Robert decides to ride north to Winterfell and ask Eddard Stark to serve as Hand of the King. He visits the <a class=\"new\" href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Winterfell_Crypts?action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Winterfell Crypts (page does not exist)\">Winterfell Crypts</a> to see the resting place of Lyanna. Robert is escorted into the feast by Catelyn. <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Jon_Snow\" title=\"Jon Snow\">Jon Snow</a> is unimpressed and disappointed with the king.\n</p>\n<p>Robert demands that Eddard ride with him on one of the days on their journey. He tells Ned that he intends to have <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Daenerys_Targaryen\" title=\"Daenerys Targaryen\">Daenerys Targaryen</a> executed.

He offers to send Lord Yohn flying for treason when Petyr casts aspersions on Yohn\'s loyalty, but allows him leniency upon Petyr\'s recommendation.

Instead, Robin is extremely temperamental, prone to hysterical fits and violent tempers. He also appears hugely entertained by the prospect of throwing prisoners and enemies through the Moon Door, giggling and clapping excitedly when it was opened for Tyrion Lannister and then disappointed when Tyrion escapes being executed.\n</p>\n<p>Robin seems to have a limited vocabulary – when younger, he refers to executions as \"seeing people fly\" but later refers to it as \"throwing through the Moon Door\" – and appears to be intellectually stunted. He is often easily distracted, shows little sense of resolve, and struggles to come to conclusions that were obvious to everyone else. Robin is also physically weak for a boy his age. While training under Lord Royce at Runestone, Robin was shown to be hopeless with a sword, and even after prolonged training he still can\'t even strike the widest ring on an archery target, struggling to hold a bow stably in his hands. However, while under Royce\'s care, Robin appears to have matured somewhat. He comes to the conclusion - though shaped by Littlefinger\'s manipulations - to send the knights of the Vale to support Sansa and <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Jon_Snow\" title=\"Jon Snow\">Jon Snow</a>\'s war effort against the Boltons on the basis that Sansa is his cousin, showing that he has at least some semblance of family honor though not particularly caring about the result of the war, flicking his hand dismissively after making his decision.\n</p>\n<p><br/>\n</p>\n<p>In the <i><a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/A_Song_of_Ice_and_Fire\" title=\"A Song of Ice and Fire\">A Song of Ice and Fire</a></i> novels, Robin\'s character is named <b>Robert Arryn</b>. The character was renamed for the television series to avoid confusion with Robert Baratheon and Robb Stark - Robb Stark and Robert Arryn both being named after King Robert. The name \"Robin\" was chosen because it allows him to keep his book nickname of \"Sweetrobin\", which is how he is more commonly known.\n</p>\n<p>Robert is six years old when the events of the books begin. He is a soft, spoiled child but also sickly, suffering from epileptic seizures which occur sporadically. His mother dotes on him a great deal. His illness, combined with his mother\'s doting, has left him intellectually and physically stunted for a boy his age. He is not weaned from his mother\'s breast. He never engages in any strenuous physical activity like practicing archery or swordsmanship, since the slightest physical exertion causes him to have seizures.\n</p>\n<p>Robert is described as a pasty, painfully thin child, small for his age and sickly all his days. He has a brown hair, spindly arms and legs, a soft concave chest, a little belly, and large eyes that are always red and runny.\n</p>\n<p>In addition to Robert\'s physical, mental and emotional deficiencies, he suffers from various phobias: for instance, a mule tried to bite him when he was little, and as a result he has never learned to ride properly, and is afraid of mules, horses and donkeys. Following his mother\'s death, he has developed three more phobias: of heights, of singing (though music without singing soothes him) and of blades. He suffers from terrible shaking fits whenever anyone approaches him with a blade in order to give him a haircut, so Littlefinger has commanded that his hair be allowed to grow.\n</p>\n<p>Author <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/George_R.R._Martin\" title=\"George R.R. Martin\">George R.R. Martin</a> made it a point to have several characters with the same name, because this happened in real life; it would be implausible to say that Robert Baratheon was the only person named \"Robert\" on an entire continent. Noble families in particular frequently re-use a small set of names, as children are named to honor famous ancestors, relatives, or major allies (i.e., Robert Arryn is named in honor of Robert Baratheon, his father\'s great ally, as is Robb Stark). One of the reasons Martin wrote the <i>A Song of Ice and Fire</i> novels is because he grew so frustrated with writing for television and film, in which budget constraints and audience attention span are a limiting factor. As Martin explained:\n</p>\n<p>In the first novel, several characters claim that Jon Arryn intended to have his son fostered by Stannis at Dragonstone; other characters claim that Robert was to be fostered by Tywin at Casterly Rock. Catelyn asks Lord Frey about those contradicting rumors, and he assures her that the first rumor is the correct one. He does not think it is important, because the fostering question was no longer an issue after Lysa fled with her son back to the Vale, but Catelyn becomes disquieted (maybe wondering if there is more to the story).\n</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Joffrey_Baratheon\" title=\"Joffrey Baratheon\">Joffrey</a> used to call Robert cruel names, and once slapped him with a wooden stick. Sansa never harms Robert physically like in the show - instead she unintentionally tears off the head of his doll which he was using to destroy her snow castle, pretending it was a giant. This causes Robert to have a seizure.\n</p>\n<p>Sansa has a very negative opinion about her cousin. After the incident with the snow castle, she thinks angrily that even Joffrey had more spine than him. Still, after Lysa\'s death Sansa sympathizes with him and treats him patiently as she can. At one occasion, he demands \"a hundred lemon cakes and five tales\"; Sansa\'s patience nearly runs out and she feels like giving him \"<i>a hundred spankings and five slaps</i>\", but restrains herself (unlike in the show).\n</p>\n<p>Robert has no idea about \"Alayne\"\'s true identity in the books. After the incident with the snow castle he declares that he hates her, because of his ripped doll, but with time grows to like her. Since he was so accustomed to sleep at his mother\'s bed, after her death he looks for other beds, and likes Sansa\'s best. Sansa wouldn\'t mind if he only slept, but since he tries to nuzzle at her breasts and wets the bed during his seizures - she has his door locked.\n</p>\n<p>On one occasion, Robert tells \"Alayne\" he wants to marry her. Sansa, who does not have the heart to tell Robert how repulsive he is in her eyes, tells him gently but firmly it is out of the question: as the Lord of the Eyrie and Defender of the Vale, he must wed a highborn lady and father a son - not a bastard. Robert does not like the idea.\n</p>\n<p>Following Lysa\'s death, Yohn Royce and five more of the most powerful Vale lords demand that Littlefinger leave the Vale and let them take care of Robert; Lord Royce intends to take him to Runestone, and raise him up to be a knight. Littlefinger manipulates them to give him a trial period of one year on his wardship over Robert.\n</p>\n<p>Littlefinger explains to Sansa that since Robert\'s health is so poor, his death is only a matter of time, at which his heir presumptive Harrold Hardyng will be the new Lord of the Vale and she will marry him. Littlefinger does not say explicitly whether he plans to \"help\" Robert die, but it is implied he does: he orders Maester Colemon to give Robert a pinch of the drug <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Essence_of_Nightshade#In_the_books\" title=\"Essence of Nightshade\">sweetsleep</a>. Colemon does not like the idea, but does as he is told. Sansa, too, orders Colemon to give Robert the same drug, but not of malicious intentions: when they have to leave the Eyrie, it is vital that Robert remains calm during the dangerous descent.\n</p>\n<p>Lords in the Vale style Lord Robert the \"True Warden of the East\" after King Robert names <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Jaime_Lannister\" title=\"Jaime Lannister\">Jaime Lannister</a> as <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Warden_of_the_East\" title=\"Warden of the East\">Warden of the East</a> due to the child lord\'s physical and mental state. Jaime continues to nominally hold the position when he spends a full year as a prisoner of the Starks after the <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Battle_of_the_Whispering_Wood\" title=\"Battle of the Whispering Wood\">Battle of the Whispering Wood</a>, though his imprisonment means that the position is left functionally vacant. The title of Warden of the East is restored to Sweetrobin by <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Tywin_Lannister\" title=\"Tywin Lannister\">Tywin Lannister</a> as one of the conditions of the marriage-alliance between Lysa and <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Petyr_Baelish\" title=\"Petyr Baelish\">Petyr Baelish</a> which brings House Arryn back into the King\'s Peace.\n</p>\n<p>In the first novel, Sweetrobin is six years old, one year younger than <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Bran_Stark\" title=\"Bran Stark\">Bran Stark</a>. Many of the younger characters have been aged-up slightly in the TV series, and in Season 1 Bran Stark stated that he was 10 years old. It is stated in the Season 5 premiere, \"<a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/The_Wars_to_Come\" title=\"The Wars to Come\">The Wars to Come</a>\", that Sweetrobin is 13 years old. The TV series also has the principle that one TV season equals one year of story time, making this about four years after Season 1. In the Season 4 finale, Lord Royce also remarked that Lysa was breastfeeding Sweetrobin as late as when he was 10 years old, which she was shown doing when they last appeared in Season 1. The numbers might be slightly off by a matter of months; i.e., \"episode one\" of any given season is early in the \"one year\" that each TV season depicts, so Sweetrobin\'s nameday might simply not have passed yet. Overall it seems that just as in the novels, Sweetrobin is one year younger than Bran Stark, but that like Bran he was aged-up by three years for Season 1. Unlike in the books by season six of the TV series Robert has grown very tall.\n</p>','https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Robin_Arryn','Robin_Arryn.jpeg',11,NULL),(760,'Robin Darklyn',0,0,NULL,'<p><b>Ser Robin Darklyn</b>, also known as <b>Darkrobin</b>, was an anointed knight of <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/House_Darklyn\" title=\"House Darklyn\">House Darklyn</a>.\n</p>\n<p>Robin was named as one of the first members of the order of the <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Kingsguard\" title=\"Kingsguard\">Kingsguard</a> after its creation by King <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Aegon_I_Targaryen\" title=\"Aegon I Targaryen\">Aegon I Targaryen</a> in 10AC.\n</p>','http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Robin_Darklyn',NULL,NULL,NULL),(761,'Robin Greyjoy',1,0,NULL,'<p><b>Robin Greyjoy</b> was the only son of Lord <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Quellon_Greyjoy\" title=\"Quellon Greyjoy\">Quellon Greyjoy</a> by his third wife. \n</p>\n<p>Robin was the ninth son of Quellon, and the only one by his third wife.

He has thin black hair that only grows on one side of his face, but he oten wears it to cover the other half. His eyes are deathly grey and frightening. He is easily recognized because half of his face was severly burned by Gregor when the was six years old, and his scars have stayed with him his whole life. This event spurred a fear of fire in Sandor, but otherwise the Hound is essentially not afraid of anything. He is a ferocious swordsman, partially because of his brutal strength and his general capacity for violence that eclipses his own brother. Many times Sandor Clegane has been offered knighthood, but he has always refused, thinking that the very concept of knights is vainglorious and hypocritical. Gregor Clegane, the monster became a knight despite his infamy throughout all of Westeros for savagery and cruelty, and his openly-known atrocities against houses of Westeros; for this, Sandor lost all respect for the institution.\n</p>\n<p>Sandor is known as a cruel and ruthless man, but he may choose to hide his more pleasant emotions. His lifelong obsession since he was a child was to kill his brother Gregor in retribution for what Gregor did to him - this hatred is stronger than any other emotion the Hound is capable of, and has sustained him all of his life. It is worth noting that Sandor is the only man truly brave enough to cross Gregor at all. Although Sandor has absolutely no qualms about killing, and is brazen about how he feels about it and how good he is at it, Sandor is still disgusted by his brother Gregor\'s actions, and that they are even accepted in society for him being a knight. Sandor has a black sense of humour, from whom he protects nobody, and even those he has an iota of respect for, he treats contemptuously. He is fully aware of how people view him, but he does not care.\n</p>\n<p>Because of Sandor\'s prodigal swordsmanship, he is one of the most feared men in the Seven Kingdoms - even in the North, his reputation is ominous. When Sansa Stark encounters him, he is scornful (at best) of her polished, childish view of knighthood and honour, and repeatedly shows her the savage truth of the situation. He also is able to provide stunningly logical arguments against knighthood, his own dishonour, and the mercy of other men.\n</p>\n<p>Despite his savagery and cruelty, Sandor is capable, in part, of being kind and even honourable, as evidenced by his gradually protective attitude towards Sansa. He goes out of his way to protect her from Joffrey\'s temper, and even concurs with her on matters that normally he wouldn\'t even care for (such as the suggested execution of Dontos Hollard). He is fully aware of Joffrey\'s stupidity, monstrous nature and desires, and even uses them against him, particularly his stupidity. Sandor scorns the idea of bravery in himself, thinking that a dog does not need courage to chase off rats.\n</p>\n<p>He seems to be the antithesis of the stereotypical white knight, primarily in that he doesn\'t believe in the nobility of knighthood.\n</p>\n<p>Aged six, maybe seven, Gregor received a gift from a woodcarver, only Sandor played with his brother\'s toy; a knight, all painted up, and its joints fixed with strings. Gregor was five years older than Sandor and the toy was nothing to him, however when he found his younger brother playing with the knight, he never said a word, just picked Sandor up and shoved the side of his face down in the burning coal of the brazier. It took three grown men to drag Gregor off him, and his father told everyone that his bed caught fire.

At the celebrations, he drunkenly discusses the tourney with Sansa Stark, frightening her with the story of how he was burned and scornfully calling her a \'little bird\' speaking words taught to her, blind to the savagery of the world. He progresses further in the tourney by defeating Jaime Lannister, entering the final round. However, when his brother is unhorsed by Ser Loras Tyrell,and Gregor vengefully tries to kill the knight publicly, Sandor intervenes. The two brothers fight heatedly, but Sandor backs away when Robert Baratheon commands it. For saving his life, Loras grants him the championship. \n</p>\n<p>King Robert eventually dies of mortal wounds sustained in a boar hunt. Afterwards, the Hound participates in the skirmish against Eddard Stark\'s men when the northerner tries to depose King Joffrey and his mother from power. He kills several of the Hand\'s men, before restraining Jeyne Poole. \n</p>\n<p>In spite of his refusal of a knighthood, Sandor replaces Ser Barristan Selmy on the Kingsguard. Surprisingly, when he is made to watch over Sansa Stark, he treats her kindly. When Joffrey cruelly shows Sansa her father\'s head, Sandor cleans the blood from her face in an almost uncharacteristic show of tenderness. \n</p>\n<p>Sandor Clegane is put to constant use during Joffrey\'s early days as king. In spite of being sworn to obey Joffrey, Sandor continuously strives to defend Sansa from the boy\'s savagery. He is the only knight of the Kingsguard never commanded to beat Sansa.\n</p>\n<p>During the tourney to celebrate Joffrey\'s nameday, Sandor frequently speaks contemptuously of the competitors, declaring that it would be a waste for him to compete; he remarks that even Joffrey could have beaten them. When Dontos Hollard is threatened with execution, Sansa jumps to his defence and suggests that it is bad luck to kill a man on his nameday, which Sandor, shockingly, supports. Joffrey thus makes Dontos his new fool, as opposed to drowning him in wine.\n</p>\n<p>Sandor, while drunk, runs into Sansa again; he calls her a stupid little girl who sings all the songs that her septa and parents taught her, and demands that Sansa sing a song for him. Though the Hound terrifies Sansa, he also protects her from Ser Boros Blount at one point. On several occasions, he openly mocks her perception of true knights, and warns her that she is surrounded by liars, monsters and killers.\n</p>\n<p>When Robb Stark continues to win victories against Tywin Lannister, Joffrey summons Sansa and has her ferociously beaten as a punishment for Robb defeating the Lannisters. When the Hound tries to stop this from happening, Joffrey commands Ser Boros Blount to strip Sansa, but Tyrion Lannister, Bronn and Timett intervene. Sandor gives Sansa his cloak when Tyrion commands it.\n</p>\n<p>When Joffrey incites a riot in King\'s Landing, Sandor once again protects Sansa when the mob hunts after her. In a fury, he kills several of the commoners, cutting off a man\'s arm at one point. However, he almost loses his precious horse Stranger in the riot, declaring that if the horse dies then he will make someone pay for it. When Sansa thanks him for protecting her, he remains utterly scornful, stating that he didn\'t do what he did out of courage, as \'<i>a dog doesn\'t need courage to chase off rats</i>\'.\n</p>\n<p>Sandor is given command during the defence of King\'s Landing during the Battle of Blackwater Bay. He leads the defence against archers on the Blackwater Rush, but loses many of his men and is eventually driven back by the wildfire that Tyrion Lannister unleashes on the Bay to destroy Stannis\' ships. He renounces the Kingsguard and Joffrey, and flees to Sansa\'s chambers. He drunkenly offers to take her away to King\'s Landing, which she refuses. Instead, he holds her at the point of a knife and orders her to sing for him, before escaping King\'s Landing and disappearing.\n</p>','https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Sandor_Clegane','Sandor_Clegane_(?The_Hound?).jpeg',38,NULL),(815,'Sansa Stark',0,1,'Ned and Cat\'s oldest daughter.

She is eleven years old when <i><a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/A_Game_of_Thrones\" title=\"A Game of Thrones\">A Game of Thrones</a></i> begins.\n</p>\n<p>Sansa has a feminine and graceful demeanor in contrast with her younger sister Arya, who has tomboy features. Sansa is very beautiful, with the thick auburn hair and blue eyes that are characteristic of members of her <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Catelyn_Stark\" title=\"Catelyn Stark\">mother\'s</a> family, <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/House_Tully\" title=\"House Tully\">House Tully</a>. Catelyn believes that Sansa will be more beautiful than herself when she is grown. Apparently, she looks quite like her mother in her youth.\n</p>\n<p>A courteous and dreamy young girl, Sansa was better known for her aspirations to become a great lady and to marry a handsome prince. Sansa loves music, dancing and lemon cakes. She used to believe that life could be like a song, with the existence of brave heroes and beautiful maids. When King Robert comes to Winterfell and arranges a marriage between her and his alleged son Joffrey, Sansa is overjoyed and becomes deeply infatuated with him, blind to the psychopathic behaviour of her betrothed, even when it is staring her in the face. Her naivete initially prevents her from recognizing the dangers around her when she is in King\'s Landing. Because Sansa is so young with a gentle and innocent demeanor, she is viewed as easily exploitable by the political players in Westeros.\n</p>\n<p>Throughout her experiences during the War of the Five Kings, Sansa has impressively started to shed the delusions she craved before coming to King\'s Landing. She is capable of realising how naïve she was, and how naïve others who used to be like her are. Traumatic events throughout her captivity, including being tormented by Joffrey, bullied by Cersei, menaced by the Hound and driven to desperation by hopes of going home, Sansa has actually become a little cleverer and a little more shrewd. She still maintains some of her innocence, but not to the same degree as the Sansa Stark who left Winterfell so long ago.\n</p>\n<p>Sansa is given her direwolf after her brothers <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Robb_Stark\" title=\"Robb Stark\">Robb Stark</a> and <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Jon_Snow\" title=\"Jon Snow\">Jon Snow</a> find a litter of six direwolf pups, one for each of the children of the Stark family. Jon and her younger brother <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Bran_Stark\" title=\"Bran Stark\">Bran Stark</a> convince their father Eddard to keep the pups. Sansa names her pup \'<a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Lady\" title=\"Lady\">Lady</a>\' and she is the smallest and sweetest of the litter. Later, when the royal retinue arrives, Sansa escorts Prince <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Joffrey_Baratheon\" title=\"Joffrey Baratheon\">Joffrey Baratheon</a> to the welcoming feast that night.\n</p>\n<p>Sansa talks with <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Jeyne_Poole\" title=\"Jeyne Poole\">Jeyne Poole</a> and <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Beth_Cassel\" title=\"Beth Cassel\">Beth Cassel</a> about how handsome Prince Joffrey is during stitching the next day. Arya thinks that Septa <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Mordane\" title=\"Mordane\">Mordane</a> worships Sansa.\n</p>\n<p>During the journey to <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/King%27s_Landing\" title=\"King\'s Landing\">King\'s Landing</a>, Sansa is introduced to Ser <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Barristan_Selmy\" title=\"Barristan Selmy\">Barristan Selmy</a>, Lord <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Renly_Baratheon\" title=\"Renly Baratheon\">Renly Baratheon</a>, and, lastly, Ser <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Ilyn_Payne\" title=\"Ilyn Payne\">Ilyn Payne</a>. Sansa thinks Ilyn to be even more frightening than <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Sandor_Clegane\" title=\"Sandor Clegane\">Sandor Clegane</a>.\n</p>\n<p>Sansa rides out with her betrothed. She and Joffrey come across Arya practicing swords with the butcher\'s son Mycah, a friend of Arya\'s. Joffrey orders Mycah to spar with him and draws his sword but Mycah does not want to spar. When Joffrey begins tormenting Mycah, Arya defends her friend and tries to fight Joffrey off. Arya\'s direwolf Nymeria arrives and defends Arya, disarming and wounding Joffrey. Sansa tries to help with Joffrey\'s wound, but Joffrey tells her to leave him. Later, when Joffrey lies that Nymeria attacked him unprovoked while Arya protests, trying to tell the truth of what happened, Sansa is called. Reluctant to betray her betrothed, Sansa claims she doesn\'t remember what happened. Cersei wants Arya\'s direwolf to be killed but Arya, fearing for Nymeria\'s life, forced her direwolf to flee earlier that day. It is Sansa\'s direwolf, Lady, who is killed for the attack in Nymeria\'s place.\n</p>\n<p>At King\'s Landing, Sansa thrives. During the Tourney of the Hand, Sansa fantasises constantly about marrying Joffrey and being queen of the Seven Kingdoms; she becomes besotted with the gallant knights, grandiosity, enthralling jousts and the sheer splendour of the event. She becomes even more distant to Arya, even to the point of openly quarrelling with her over what happened on the Kingsroad. Sansa bitterly blames Arya for the death of her precious direwolf, overlooking the fact that her lying for Joffrey was a crucial factor that led up to Lady\'s demise. However, she soon encounters the menacing Sandor Clegane, the Hound; on one of the nights of the tourney, Sandor confides in her the brutal and nightmarish story of how he was burned, and is utterly scornful of her prim and ladylike nature.\n</p>\n<p>Eventually, her father discovers that Joffrey and his siblings are the products of incest between Ser Jaime Lannister and the queen. He plans on sending his daughters back to Winterfell to protect them from the queen in the quarrel that may come, which horrifies Sansa. Desperate to marry Joffrey, Sansa betrays her father to the queen, in the hopes that Cersei will allow her to stay and be the future queen. However, she plays right into Cersei\'s hands, and Cersei moves against Eddard Stark, leading to the slaughter of his men and his arrest. Confined to Maegor\'s Holdfast, Sansa pleads her father\'s case to Joffrey and his courtiers. Joffrey promises he will be merciful, but instead executes her father before the Sept of Baelor, right in front of her.\n</p>\n<p>Sansa is confined again after the execution; Cersei plans on continuing with Joffrey\'s marriage to Sansa when she flowers, since then Joffrey can have a son with her. Sansa, only wanting to go home and be safe, is kept as a hostage in the capital, and denounces her father and older brother Robb as traitors to the crown. When Joffrey torments Sansa by showing her Eddard\'s head, Sansa is <i>sorely</i> tempted to push the young king to his death regardless of what happens to her, but the Hound steps in and thwarts her at the last second.\n</p>','https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Sansa_Stark','Sansa_Stark.jpeg',144,18),(816,'Saranella',0,0,NULL,'<p><b>Septa Saranella</b> was a septa of the <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Faith_of_the_Seven\" title=\"Faith of the Seven\">Faith of the Seven</a> in service at <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Casterly_Rock\" title=\"Casterly Rock\">Casterly Rock</a> during the rule of Lord <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Tywin_Lannister\" title=\"Tywin Lannister\">Tywin Lannister</a>.\n</p>\n<p>After the drowning of <a class=\"new\" href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Melara_Hetherspoon?action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Melara Hetherspoon (page does not exist)\">Melara Hetherspoon</a>, <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Cersei_Lannister\" title=\"Cersei Lannister\">Cersei Lannister</a> asks Saranella what the Valyrian word valonqar means.

Stannis is a harsh, unforgiving and painfully stubborn man who has never truly learned to flatter or submit, giving his opinions openly and unconsciously challenging people to tell him otherwise. He does not partake in wanton cruelty, but he is completely capable of being merciless: he would not have forgiven or pardoned many Targaryen loyalists after Robert\'s Rebellion came to an end. For this, Stannis is hugely unpopular among the lords of Westeros, who think that he lacks love or loyalty. In contrast, Renly is an incredibly popular young man, but frivolous and vainglorious and proud in an entirely different way.\n</p>\n<p>In his own way, Stannis is an especially dutiful man who keeps to his word and is actually respectable in his actions. He aspires to have his throne because it is his by right, rather than any narcissistic desires or delusions of grandeur that the likes of Joffrey suffered from. Stannis was a fiercely reliable man who served Robert loyally and effectively in his capacities, and helped shatter the ironborn when they rebelled against Robert. He held Storm\'s End against the immense Tyrell strike force that tried to besiege it, even though it nearly cost him and his wife their lives - he respected loyalty and efficiency and duty immensely, giving Davos Seaworth a knighthood and lands of his own, but taking joints from his hand on account of his criminal past. Stannis was willing to be Robert\'s lieutenant and inferior because, by law, Robert was his sovereign, but he mercilessly demanded such loyalty when Robert died and Stannis, with only bastard pretenders in his way, was heir to the Iron Throne.\n</p>\n<p>Stannis cared for his men at least, feeding them during the Siege of Storm\'s End before feeding himself. He also feared for his family, including his charmless, cruel and cynical wife and his diseased daughter, both of whom were not popular or even respected in Westeros. Those who didn\'t personally like Stannis respected him for his accomplishments and his dutiful nature.\n</p>\n<p>Stannis has long since ceased serving the Faith of the Seven: He decided long ago that any god who took his mother and father away from him so young did not deserve his worship.\n</p>\n<p>When Stannis was a child, the ship carrying his parents home was thrown against the rocks during a storm , as they were returning from a failed mission given to them by King Aerys to find a bride for his, son, Rhaegar. The ship sank and his parents died before the very walls of Storm\'s End. Stannis later claims this is the reason why he stopped believing in gods.\n</p>\n<p>During <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Robert%27s_Rebellion\" title=\"Robert\'s Rebellion\">Robert\'s Rebellion</a>, Stannis held his brothers seat of power, <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Storm%27s_End\" title=\"Storm\'s End\">Storm\'s End</a>, under great adversity. They were under siege by the forces of the <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/House_Tyrell\" title=\"House Tyrell\">House Tyrell</a> and were so low on food by the end that they had to resort to eating the rats. They would have eaten their own dead , had Ser Davos not smuggled in his onions. Despite this , Stannis was not thanked for his service. Instead , Lord Eddard Stark was thrown a feast to celebrate his \"victory\" over Lord Tyrell , who did not even put up a fight. Stannis was then sent to Dragonstone to capture Viserys and Danearys. However , they escaped his grasp when he stormed the castle. Robert then gave Storm\'s End with its lordship of the Stormlands to Renly Baratheon, who was still a small child, rather than Stannis. This slight was not forgiven by Stannis, even though he was given the lands of <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Dragonstone\" title=\"Dragonstone\">Dragonstone</a> and a seat on the <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Small_council\" title=\"Small council\">small council</a>, where he served as <a class=\"new\" href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Master_of_Ships?action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Master of Ships (page does not exist)\">Master of Ships</a>.\n</p>\n<p>Eight years after these events, Lord <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Balon_Greyjoy\" title=\"Balon Greyjoy\">Balon Greyjoy</a> wagered that King Robert had not won the support of the lords of Westeros. After much preparation, he struck, sending <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Victarion_Greyjoy\" title=\"Victarion Greyjoy\">Victarion Greyjoy</a>, his brother, to destroy the <a class=\"new\" href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Lannister_Fleet?action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Lannister Fleet (page does not exist)\">Lannister Fleet</a>. Lord <a class=\"new\" href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Tywin_Lannnister?action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Tywin Lannnister (page does not exist)\">Tywin</a> was caught unawares, and the Lannnister fleet was torched. Robert then sent Stannis to deal with the Ironborn fleet. Stannis then set a trap at <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Fair_Isle\" title=\"Fair Isle\">Fair Isle</a>, were he descended from both the north and the south when the <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Iron_Fleet\" title=\"Iron Fleet\">Iron Fleet</a> was still stuck in between. As a result, the Iron Fleet was completely destroyed, which allowed Robert to ferry men to the <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Iron_Islands\" title=\"Iron Islands\">Iron Islands</a> themselves. While Robert saved <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Pyke\" title=\"Pyke\">Pyke</a> for himself, Stannis was sent to deal with <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Great_Wyk\" title=\"Great Wyk\">Great Wyk</a>, the largest of the Iron Islands. He successfully captured it as Robert stormed Pyke and forced Balon to bend the knee.\n</p>\n<p>Fifteen years after the Rebellion, Stannis starts to suspect that Robert\'s children are not his own, and are instead bastards born of incest between Queen <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Cersei_Lannister\" title=\"Cersei Lannister\">Cersei</a> and her brother <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Jaime_Lannister\" title=\"Jaime Lannister\">Jaime Lannister</a>. He enlists the aid of <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Jon_Arryn\" title=\"Jon Arryn\">Jon Arryn</a>, <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Hand_of_the_King\" title=\"Hand of the King\">Hand of the King</a> to investigate, because Stannis knows that Robert will never listen to anything he has to say, nor did he have a sufficent power base to counter the Lannisters alone. The two investigate Robert\'s many bastards during this time, including <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Gendry\" title=\"Gendry\">Gendry</a>, in order to gather further proof for their theory (as all Baratheon children born in the male line over the years, including Robert\'s bastards, have been black-haired, in contrast to Cersei\'s children, who are golden-haired). When Arryn suddenly dies Stannis leaves <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/King%27s_Landing\" title=\"King\'s Landing\">King\'s Landing</a> for Dragonstone and begins building up his forces, hiring sellswords and seizing ships, for the war he knows is inevitably coming.\n</p>\n<p>After the death of Jon Arryn, Stannis flees to Dragonstone to gather his strength, including most of the royal fleet, and plan his next move, believing Cersei poisoned Jon. <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Eddard_Stark\" title=\"Eddard Stark\">Eddard Stark</a> suggests that Robert name Stannis Warden of the East as a reward for his valour during Robert\'s Rebellion. Robert has already given the title to Ser <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Jaime_Lannister\" title=\"Jaime Lannister\">Jaime Lannister</a>. Stannis is also mentioned as to having a dislike to prostitution , even going so far to asking to have it banned , with Robert replying that if that happened , might as well ban shitting and eating.\n</p>\n<p>Lord Eddard Stark wonders why Stannis left, believing it was due to the discovery of whatever secret Jon Arryn was allegedly murdered for, although not realizing that Stannis was also slighted by King Robert I Baratheon\'s selection of Eddard as his new Hand of the King. Ned, via Grand Maester <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Pycelle\" title=\"Pycelle\">Pycelle</a>, sends a raven with a polite letter requesting Lord Stannis to return to his seat on the small council. During Eddard\'s investigation of Jon\'s death, he discovers that Stannis and Jon had spent a great deal of time together. When he is told Stannis and Jon visited a brothel, when Stannis is normally so righteous to the point of prudish, he gets closer to the truth.\n</p>\n<p>Robert dies after a boar hunt and is succeeded by his son, Joffrey I Baratheon. Eddard has been selected by Robert to rule as regent, though plans to bring Stannis to the throne. However, he is outmaneuvered by Robert\'s widow, Queen <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Cersei_Lannister\" title=\"Cersei Lannister\">Cersei Lannister</a>. The boy king <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Joffrey_Baratheon\" title=\"Joffrey Baratheon\">Joffrey</a> subsequently has Eddard executed.\n</p>\n<p>Lord <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Varys\" title=\"Varys\">Varys</a> reports to the small council that Stannis is said to be building ships, hiring sellswords, and bringing a shadowbinder from Asshai to Dragonstone.\n</p>\n<p>Stannis declares himself king on Dragonstone. He sends Ser <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Davos_Seaworth\" title=\"Davos Seaworth\">Davos Seaworth</a> to gather support for him among the stormlords, but none are willing to join him. His maester, <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Cressen\" title=\"Cressen\">Cressen</a>, suggests to Stannis that he makes an alliance against the Lannisters with <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Robb_Stark\" title=\"Robb Stark\">Robb Stark</a>, who has been declared <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/King_in_the_North\" title=\"King in the North\">King in the North</a>, but Stannis objects to ruling only half a kingdom. Cressen then proposes that Stannis sends Shireen, his only child and heir, to the <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Eyrie\" title=\"Eyrie\">Eyrie</a>, to make an alliance with Lady <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Lysa_Arryn\" title=\"Lysa Arryn\">Lysa Arryn</a>, but Stannis\'s wife, Selyse Florent, objects, stating that Stannis should not have to beg for help, and Stannis sides with her.\n</p>\n<p>Selyse has converted to the faith of R\'hllor, the Lord of Light, giving the priestess Melisandre a base of power on Dragonstone. Selyse tells Stannis that the red comet is a sign that Stannis\'s time has come, and that he must sail from Dragonstone now to conquer. Selyse claims that Renly\'s men will join Stannis once Renly dies, and that Melisandre has seen Renly dead in her flames. Cressen is horrified by the thought of fratricide and objects, but Stannis dismisses him. Though Stannis is not a follower of R\'hllor, he denounces the <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Faith_of_the_Seven\" title=\"Faith of the Seven\">Faith of the Seven</a> for the Lord of Light, burning the carvings of the seven gods from the Faith as a sacrifice. During this sacrifice, Melisandre proclaims that Stannis is Azor Ahai reborn, and has him pull a sword out of the burning carvings: Lightbringer. With Davos Seaworth\'s help, Stannis has recruited <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Salladhor_Saan\" title=\"Salladhor Saan\">Salladhor Saan</a> for his cause. In private, Sallador tells Davos that the sword is not the real Lightbringer.Stannis writes a letter announcing his claim to the throne and the bastardy of <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Joffrey_Baratheon\" title=\"Joffrey Baratheon\">Joffrey</a>, <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Myrcella_Baratheon\" title=\"Myrcella Baratheon\">Myrcella</a> a and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Tommen_Baratheon\" title=\"Tommen Baratheon\">Tommen</a>, which he plans to send to the lords of the Seven Kingdoms by raven, and to the ports of Westeros and the <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Free_Cities\" title=\"Free Cities\">Free Cities</a> by ship. Davos tells Stannis that he has no proof of the incest, but Stannis claims that at Storm\'s End there is proof, though he does not have access. Davos further informs Stannis that it would be unwise to declare for the Lord of Light, if he wishes to win over the followers of the Faith of the Seven, but Stannis rejects the notion, as he believes Melisandre has power.\n</p>\n<p>While his brother Renly is slowly marching from <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Highgarden\" title=\"Highgarden\">Highgarden</a> to <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/King%27s_Landing\" title=\"King\'s Landing\">King\'s Landing</a> by the <a class=\"new\" href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Roseroad?action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Roseroad (page does not exist)\">Roseroad</a>, Stannis sails for Storm\'s End and besieges the castle. Renly rushes to Storm\'s End with ten thousand of his host to meet Stannis, claiming that he has another hundred thousand on their way. Stannis and Renly parley, and Renly offers Stannis a chance to swear him his fealthy, which Stannis angrily rejects. He calls Renly a traitor, as well as threatens Robb Stark to Lady <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Catelyn_Stark\" title=\"Catelyn Stark\">Catelyn Stark</a>. When it becomes clear that Renly, who does not care about Stannis\'s letter and is confident in his own strength, will not swear to Stannis, Stannis leaves, promising a battle at dawn. Catelyn informs Renly about the murder attempt on her son Bran\'s life, which she blames on the Lannisters. She now believes that <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Brandon_Stark\" title=\"Brandon Stark\">Bran</a> saw <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Cersei_Lannister\" title=\"Cersei Lannister\">Cersei</a> and Jaime having sex, and asks leave to go to Stannis to tell him of her suspicions, suggesting that Stannis, Renly and Robb all cast aside their crowns to call a Great Council. Renly refuses, and is about to continue preparing for battle when a shadow kills him. Stannis\'s shadow, according to Catelyn Stark. Most of the forces Renly had brought with him to Storm\'s End join Stannis.\n</p>\n<p>Following Renly\'s death, Stannis is troubled by terrible nightmares, and only Melisandre, who now shares his pavillon, can soothe him to sleep. He confides in Davos that he sometimes dreams of Renly\'s death, but that he is innocent, as he had been in his bed when Renly was slain, and that his squire, <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Devan_Seaworth\" title=\"Devan Seaworth\">Devan Seaworth</a>, had been unable to wake him. Stannis has surrounded Storm\'s End by land and sea, and promises that the garrison might go free unharmed is the castle is yielded up to him in a fortnight. Ser <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Cortnay_Penrose\" title=\"Cortnay Penrose\">Cortnay Penrose</a> continues to refuse, however, even during the last parley a fortnight later, as yielding require giving Stannis Robert\'s bastard son, <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Edric_Storm\" title=\"Edric Storm\">Edric Storm</a>. Cortnay challenges Stannis to single combat to decide the matter, but Stannis refuses. Unwilling to leave Storm\'s End untaken out of fear that it will be viewed as a defeat, and determined to get a hold of Robert\'s bastard to proof the incest, Stannis orders Davos to land a small boat beneath the castle, unseen in the black of the night, without anyone else knowing about it, taking Melisandre with him. Davos brings Melisandre beneath the castle, where she gives birth to a Stannis\'s shadow which enters the castle. That same night, Cortnay falls off a tower of the castle to his death, and the castle yields to Stannis, who subsequently burns the godswood of Storm\'s End. It is said that Cortnay threw himself off of the tower, and his guards could not find anyone else in the room, nor had they seen anyone else enter. However, Lord Varys believes Cortnay to have been killed with magic.\n</p>\n<p>With Storm\'s End fallen, Stannis is free to march for King\'s Landing, which has been preparing for his arrival. <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Tyrion_Lannister\" title=\"Tyrion Lannister\">Tyrion Lannister</a> has the <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/High_Septon\" title=\"High Septon\">High Septon</a> spread the news that Stannis means to burn to <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Great_Sept_of_Baelor\" title=\"Great Sept of Baelor\">Great Sept of Baelor</a>, to prevent people in the city from joining Stannis. Tyrion Lannister has ordered his men from the Vale mountain clans to light fires to burn the grass, while killing his scouts and raiding his baggage train. In response, Stannis\'s vanguard sets the the <a class=\"new\" href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Kingswood?action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Kingswood (page does not exist)\">kingswood</a> afire, to smoke the clansmen out.\n</p>\n<p>Stannis attacks King\'s Landing during the <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Battle_of_the_Blackwater\" title=\"Battle of the Blackwater\">Battle of the Blackwater</a>. Most of Stannis\'s ships enter the harbor, but the Lannisters light wildfire, and when a chain prevents the ships from sailing out of the harbor again, most of them are destroyed. Stannis\'s forces are close to victory, when Lord <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Tywin_Lannister\" title=\"Tywin Lannister\">Tywin Lannister</a> and the forces of House Tyrell arrive, led by the \"ghost\" of Renly Baratheon, who is later revealed to have been <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Garlan_Tyrell\" title=\"Garlan Tyrell\">Garlan Tyrell</a>, dressed in Renly\'s armor.\n</p>\n<p>Defeated during the Battle of the Blackwater, Stannis returns to Dragonstone on the ships of the <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Lys\" title=\"Lys\">Lyseni</a> Salladhor Saan with the few men that remain to him, most of them the queen\'s men. He names Lord <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Alester_Florent\" title=\"Alester Florent\">Alester Florent</a> as his Hand of the King, but refuses to see anyone but Melisandre, brooding in the <a class=\"new\" href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Stone_Drum?action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Stone Drum (page does not exist)\">Stone Drum</a> instead. He does not eat, and tales are told claiming that Stannis and Melisandre go down into the <a class=\"new\" href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Dragonmont?action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Dragonmont (page does not exist)\">Dragonmont</a> to watch the fires inside. After Davos Seaworth is arrested for his plan to kill Melisandre, Melisandre visits him, and informs him that she dare not make another shadow son with Stannis as his \"fires burn so low\" that doing to might kill him. Stannis\'s Hand, Alester, loses faith in Stannis\'s chances for succes, and prepares to offer peace to House Lannister, to be sealed with the promise that Stannis gives up his claim to the <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Iron_Throne\" title=\"Iron Throne\">Iron Throne</a> and retracts all he said regarding the bastardy of Cersei Lannister\'s children in exchange for being accepted back into the King\'s peace and being allowed to rule as Lord of Dragonstone and Lord of Storm\'s End. Alester wishes to seal the bargain by offering Shireen in marriage to Tommen Baratheon. However, before he can send his letter to King\'s Landing, he is arrested for treason.\n</p>\n<p>Stannis has Davos brought before him. While escorting Davos to Stannis in the Chamber of the Painted Table, Ser <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Axell_Florent\" title=\"Axell Florent\">Axell Florent</a> tries to make Davos tell Stannis that Axell should be named the King\'s Hand. Stannis informs Davos that Axell wishes to resume the war, and has Axell put his plans to sack <a class=\"new\" href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Claw_Isle?action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Claw Isle (page does not exist)\">Claw Isle</a> to Davos. Stannis wishes to know Davos\'s opinion on the plans, and sends Axell away when the conversation turns badly, while asking for Melisandre. Davos shares his suspicions about Melisandre with Stannis, but Stannis states he does not believe Renly\'s death was Melisandre\'s doing. He shares Davos\'s opinion on Axell\'s plans, however, and raises Davos up to be the Lord of the <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Rainwood\" title=\"Rainwood\">Rainwood</a>, Admiral of the <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Narrow_Sea\" title=\"Narrow Sea\">Narrow Sea</a>, and his Hand of the King. Stannis reveals that he has seen a high hill in a forest, where men in black had made a ring of torches, and where shapes were moving through the snow. Though Melisandre has been trying to convince him to sacrifice Edric Storm, Robert\'s acknowledged bastard, Stannis refuses, ordering her to use leeches instead. Stannis throws the three leeches into the fire one by one, stating the names of the other three kings (Joffrey Baratheon, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Balon_Greyjoy\" title=\"Balon Greyjoy\">Balon Greyjoy</a>, and Robb Stark).\n</p>\n<p>Both Balon and Robb die not long after, leading to a discussion among Stannis\'s counselors whether Edric should be sacrificed to wake a dragon from stone, as Melisandre claims will happen. Davos attempts to convince Stannis not to sacrifice Edric once they are alone, but Stannis admits that, should Joffrey die as well, he is willing to consider doing it. Upon hearing the news of Joffrey\'s death, Stannis is willing to sacrifice Edric, though he still does not like the idea. However, several of the men still loyal to him have forsaken R\'hllor and returned to the Faith again, and Davos has found several of them willing to help him smuggle the boy to safety under the care of Ser <a class=\"new\" href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Andrew_Estermont?action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Andrew Estermont (page does not exist)\">Andrew Estermont</a>. Stannis is furious, but Davos urges Stannis to sail for the Wall, claiming that \"a king protects his people, or he is no king at all\", and presents his king with Maester <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Aemon_Targaryen\" title=\"Aemon Targaryen\">Aemon</a>\'s letter asking for aid.\n</p>\n<p><br/>\nMelisandre sacrifices a man to R\'hllor to gain favorable winds and sails north. He leaves Selyse and Shireen at <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Eastwatch-by-the-Sea\" title=\"Eastwatch-by-the-Sea\">Eastwatch-by-the-Sea</a> while marching west with all his forces. They arrive in time to defeat <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Mance_Rayder\" title=\"Mance Rayder\">Mance Rayder</a>\'s wildling army during the <a class=\"new\" href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Battle_of_Castle_Black?action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Battle of Castle Black (page does not exist)\">Battle of Castle Black</a>. Stannis occupies the <a class=\"new\" href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/King%27s_Tower?action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"King\'s Tower (page does not exist)\">King\'s Tower</a> at <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Castle_Black\" title=\"Castle Black\">Castle Black</a>. Though he plans to burn Mance Rayder, he is willing to allow the other <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Free_Folk\" title=\"Free Folk\">free folk</a> through the Wall if they swear to R\'hllor, settling them in <a class=\"new\" href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/The_Gift?action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"The Gift (page does not exist)\">the Gift</a>. He has <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Jon_Snow\" title=\"Jon Snow\">Jon Snow</a> brought to him, and offers to legitimize him and name him Lord of <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Winterfell\" title=\"Winterfell\">Winterfell</a> in exchange for Jon\'s help in winning the north to his side. He allows Jon time to think about the offfer. As Stannis needs to negotiate with the <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Lord_Commander_of_the_Night%27s_Watch\" title=\"Lord Commander of the Night\'s Watch\">Lord Commander of the Night\'s Watch</a>, he is displeased that after ten days of voting, the black brothers still have not yet chosen a new commander, and calls several of the higher ranking men to him to inform them that he will chose a Lord Commander for them, if they do not come to a decision that same day. Stannis informs maester Aemon and <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Samwell_Tarly\" title=\"Samwell Tarly\">Samwell Tarly</a> that he has send word to his castellan to begin mining dragonglass at Dragonstone to fight the <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Others\" title=\"Others\">Others</a>, and confirms that he is aware of Aemon\'s ancestry. Aemon requests to see <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Lightbringer\" title=\"Lightbringer\">Lightbringer</a>, and Stannis grants the request. Thanks to Samwell\'s involvement, Jon Snow is elected as Lord Commander, preventing him from accepting Stannis\'s offer.\n</p>\n<p>Stannis keeps his wildling prisoners <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Beyond_the_Wall\" title=\"Beyond the Wall\">beyond the Wall</a>.

Jon Snow cedes ownership of the <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Nightfort\" title=\"Nightfort\">Nightfort</a> to Stannis, but refuses to give Stannis ownership of the other fifteen castles at the Wall that are unoccupied by the black brothers, and asks Stannis for men instead to serve under the command of his own commanders.\n</p>\n<p>Stannis sends Davos Seaworth to <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/White_Harbor\" title=\"White Harbor\">White Harbor</a> to treat with Lord <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Wyman_Manderly\" title=\"Wyman Manderly\">Wyman Manderly</a> on his behalf, as well sends <a class=\"new\" href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Richard_Horpe?action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Richard Horpe (page does not exist)\">Richard Horpe</a> and <a class=\"new\" href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Justin_Massey?action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Justin Massey (page does not exist)\">Justin Massey</a> as envoys south.

Jon Snow tells him his plan will never succeed. The Dreadfort will learn of his approach long before he can ever reach the castle, and Moat Cailin will fall quickly, which means that Ramsay and <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Roose_Bolton\" title=\"Roose Bolton\">Roose Bolton</a> are free to march against Stannis with their entire force. Additionally, marching with the wildlings will only serve to turn the northmen against Stannis. Instead, Jon proposes that Stannis visit the mountain clans, including the Flints, Wulls, Norreys and Liddles. Instead of the Dreadfort, Jon suggests marching against <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Deepwood_Motte\" title=\"Deepwood Motte\">Deepwood Motte</a> to fight the ironborn. In exchange, the wildlings remain at the Wall.\n</p>\n<p>At White Harbor, Lord Wyman Manderly arrests Stannis\'s envoy and Hand, Davos Seaworth, and fakes his execution. In secret, he promises to swear loyalty to Stannis if Davos can bring him <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Rickon_Stark\" title=\"Rickon Stark\">Rickon Stark</a>.\n</p>\n<p>Stannis follows the advice of Jon Snow and wins over several of the moutain clans, gathering an additional three thousand men for his army.

As the Iron Throne has ceased payments of the loans, the Iron Bank wishes to broach the subject to Stannis. Jon Snow receives Tycho and realises that if Stannis gives in to the demands of the Iron Bank, the Braavosi will give him their support, which might win him the Iron Throne. <a class=\"new\" href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Alys_Karstark?action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Alys Karstark (page does not exist)\">Alys Karstark</a> arrives at Castle Black, and warns Jon that her uncle, Arnolf Karstark, is only feigning loyalty to Stannis.

Tycho travels to Deepwood Motte in search of Stannis, and from there continues to the crofters\' village as well. Near Winterfell, Tycho finds Mors Umber with a captive <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Theon_Greyjoy\" title=\"Theon Greyjoy\">Theon Greyjoy</a> and \"<a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Jeyne_Poole\" title=\"Jeyne Poole\">Arya Stark</a>\", who he brings with him to Stannis.\n</p>\n<p>Jon Snow receives a taunting letter at Castle Black from Ramsay, stating that Stannis was killed along with most of his army in seven days of battle. The validity of this letter remains unknown.\n</p>\n<p>Stannis is actively and efficiently preparing for the looming battle against the Boltons. He signs a contract with the Braavosi banker <a class=\"new\" href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Tycho_Nestoris?action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Tycho Nestoris (page does not exist)\">Tycho Nestoris</a>, and plans to send Tycho back to the Wall for safety. Tycho brought a message from Jon Snow informing Stannis of Arnolf Karstark\'s planned treachery, after which Stannis arrests Arnolf, his son <a class=\"new\" href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Arthor_Karstark?action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Arthor Karstark (page does not exist)\">Arthor</a>, and his three grandsons arrested and plans to execute them. He sends Ser Justin Massey to escort \"Arya Stark\" back to Castle Black to reunite her with Jon Snow, in gratitude for Jon\'s counsel of gathering the northern mountain clans. Massey is to then travel to Braavos and use money from the Iron Bank to hire twenty thousand sellswords for Stannis. Stannis tells Massey that he may hear of Stannis\' death in Braavos, but even if that news is true, Massey is to follow the orders as to seat Shireen on the Iron Throne. Stannis next receives Asha Greyjoy, and informs her that her brother Theon must be executed, as showing him mercy would mean losing all of the northmen.\n</p>','https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Stannis_Baratheon','Stannis_Baratheon.jpeg',16,NULL),(851,'Steffarion Sparr',1,0,NULL,'<p><b>Steffarion Sparr</b> is the only known child of <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/The_Sparr\" title=\"The Sparr\">The Sparr</a>, an Ironborn lord on the island of <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Great_Wyk\" title=\"Great Wyk\">Great Wyk</a>.

They meet when Robb captures <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/The_Crag\" title=\"The Crag\">The Crag</a>, an ancient and decaying stronghold which serves as the seat of <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/House_Westerling\" title=\"House Westerling\">House Westerling</a>. In the process of storming the castle Robb is wounded when he takes an arrow to the arm. Jeyne nurses him back to health and they grew close during that time. Robb is still there when word of the deaths of Bran and Rickon arrives (though <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Theon_Greyjoy\" title=\"Theon Greyjoy\">Theon Greyjoy</a> was actually lying when he claimed they were dead). Jeyne comforts Robb in his distress, and they end up having sex. As she is highborn and as Robb has taken her maidenhead not only does he feel honor-bound to marry her, but he has fallen in love with her. He does not suspect that the Westerlings (at least Jeyne\'s mother and uncle) collaborate with the Lannisters, as revealed in \"A Feast for Crows\". Their assignment is to make Robb breach his pact with the Freys, and it is accomplished. It is unclear whether Jeyne was aware of her family\'s collusion.\n</p>\n<p>All these events happen off-screen when Robb is in the west and are not revealed in the books until he returns with Jeyne to <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Riverrun\" title=\"Riverrun\">Riverrun</a>. Robb doesn\'t discuss breaking his marriage pact with Catelyn until after his marriage, and the marriage is not done in secret. Furthermore, Jeyne never becomes pregnant with Robb\'s heir (her mother made certain of that, presumably by giving her Moon tea) and isn\'t present at the Twins during the \"Red Wedding\". Thus, she\'s alive and well afterwards, under the protection of Brynden Tully, who remains in Riverrun as Robb\'s Warden of the Southern Marches.\n</p>\n<p>After the <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Second_Siege_of_Riverrun\" title=\"Second Siege of Riverrun\">siege of Riverrun</a> is resolved, Jaime meets Jeyne and her mother. He thinks Jeyne is pretty, but not a girl to lose a kingdom for. She seems to mourn Robb genuinely, but it could be a pretence. At Jaime\'s command, Jeyne and her family are escorted back to the Crag. Since Jaime does not trust Sybell\'s word that Jeyne is not pregnant, he orders the escorting soldiers to shoot Jeyne down if she attempts to escape, to avoid tales that her dead husband Robb had given her a child and thus an heir to the north.\n</p>','https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Talisa_Stark','Talisa_Stark.jpeg',144,NULL),(867,'Tanda Stokeworth',0,0,NULL,'<p>Tanda Stokeworth is the Head of House Stokeworth.\n</p>','http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Tanda_Stokeworth',NULL,145,NULL),(868,'Tarle',1,0,NULL,'<p><b>Tarle</b>, better known as <b>Tarle the Thrice-Drowned</b>, is a member of the order of the <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Drowned_Men\" title=\"Drowned Men\">Drowned Men</a>.

A sharp-tongued man with a ferocious wit and an inability to suffer fools gladly, Tyrion is a practical and sly individual who has been disillusioned throughout his entire life to the cruelties of the world. As a result of monstrous and prejudicial treatment at the hands of his father and sister, and almost everyone who has ever met him, Tyrion has developed a thick skin against other people\'s opinion of him, and even resolves t ouse it to his advantage. Many people underestimate him for being a dwarf, and are often shocked by how capable he is at outwitting them.\n</p>\n<p>He craves for love and respect from his family, but there are precious few with whom he has a good relationship. His worst relationship is with his father Tywin, who has hated him from birth and considered him an embarrassment to the name of Lannister. Despite this, even Tywin is capable of recognising that Tyrion is the cleverest of his children, and isn\'t above trusting him with some responsibility. Cersei, on the other hand, has never ceased to hate him, despite anything good that happens between them. Tyrion and Cersei have a mutual tendency to think about killing each other, but despite this Tyrion has never personally threatened her (at least, not until the War of the Five Kings). Jaime is the only immediate relative to truly respect and love him, and has been a good brother for most of their lives, being both protective, admiring and affectionate towards him since he was a child (which is ironic, because on the surface they are almost completely different). However, this changes perhaps forever after the events of Tyrion\'s trial for Joffrey\'s murder, and the terrible circumstances that take place in it.\n</p>\n<p>Tyrion is by no means a flawless man: he has indulged for most of his adulthood in wine and women, and the multiple traumas he has suffered since childhood have spurred him further into these vices. Despite this, he is deeply compassionate towards those who have suffered, almost exclusively: he treats Sansa Stark kindly, and is impressively reluctant to engage sexually with her, knowing that she is a child, and that she despises him and his entire family.\n</p>\n<p>Tyrion was born to Tywin and Joanna Lannister and is their youngest child. Joanna died birthing Tyrion, and as a result of Joanna\'s death and Tyrion\'s dwarfism, his father Tywin Lannister resents him. Tyrion has two older siblings, twins Jaime Lannister and Cersei Lannister. Jaime and Cersei were eight years old at the time of their mother\'s death. Like their father, Cersei also resents Tyrion for their mother\'s death, but Jaime always treated Tyrion well.\n</p>\n<p>As a teenager, Tyrion and his brother Jaime found a girl being attacked on the road. While Jaime ran off the attackers, Tyrion took the girl to an inn and comforted her. They had sex and Tyrion secretly marries the girl. He is happy with her for a fortnight. It was not known by Jaime that subsequently the two were married. When Tywin found out, he was furious. He had Jaime confess that the girl was a prostitute and that he had staged the attack to make Tyrion happy. She was to pretend to act as if she was about to be raped and then to allow Tyrion to seduce her. Tywin had 50 of his soldiers have sex with Tysha in front of Tyrion, making him go last. Tyrion has never stopped thinking about <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Tysha\" title=\"Tysha\">Tysha</a>, as this was the only time of his life that he was happy.\n</p>\n<p>Tyrion Lannister goes to <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Winterfell\" title=\"Winterfell\">Winterfell</a> with King <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Robert_Baratheon\" title=\"Robert Baratheon\">Robert Baratheon</a>\'s party.

In order to hide <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Shae\" title=\"Shae\">Shae</a>, knowing Cersei will try to harm her in order to harm Tyrion, he sets her up in a manse outside of the Red Keep.

He visits a brothel and takes a whore named <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Alayaya\" title=\"Alayaya\">Alayaya</a> up to a room. Going into a tunnel which takes him to a stable, he can then ride in disguise to Shae\'s manse.

Even King <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Aegon_V_Targaryen\" title=\"Aegon V Targaryen\">Aegon V</a> was upset with his way of ruling. Tytos had few supporters, one of which was Denys Marbrand, Jeyne’s father, the other was his younger brother Jason, who was 9 years younger than he was. People would borrow from Tytos, knowing that they didn’t have to pay it back. Tytos was constantly pardoning people. He sent ravens to <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Quellon_Greyjoy\" title=\"Quellon Greyjoy\">Quellon Greyjoy</a> demanding that the Greyjoys stop their raids.\n</p>\n<p>One autumn, Tytos came between a lioness and her prey. The lioness tore into Tytos\' horse and was about to attack Tytos as well, when the kennelmaster of Casterly Rock came to his rescue with his dogs, losing his leg and three dogs in the process. Out of gratitude, Tytos gave the kennelmaster lands and a towerhouse and took his son as a squire, thereby creating House Clegane.\n</p>\n<p>By 254 AC, Lords knew that Tytos was not feared. Ironborn reavers and pirates all the way from the Stepstones raided the coastlines.\n</p>\n<p>He gave in marriage his only daughter, Genna Lannister, to Lord Walder\'s second son; Emmon Frey, despite many, including a 10-year-old Tywin, believing it was an unequal match, simply because Lord Walder asked him nicely.

His golden hair was shaved when it began to turn grey, except for great golden whiskers on the sides of his face. He is described to be flat-stomached and slender, with broad shoulders. He is seldom seen without the Lannister colours of red or gold, or wearing some kind of ornamentation of his house; in battle, he wears red armour with gold highlights and a cloth-of-gold cape so heavy that golden lions are fused to the armour to carry it. Tywin does not believe in half-measures, does not forget a slight, and does not <i>ever</i> forgive.\n</p>\n<p>Tywin is efficient, ruthless, controlling, proud, fiercely intelligent and stoic to a fault. With enormous authority at his disposal and the reputation for having extinguished vassal houses for defying him, Tywin is one of the most feared men in the Seven Kingdoms, the most respected and one of the most hated men also. He has a reputation for being extremely financially powerful and it was even remarked that he defecated gold as he had so much of it. He is extremely cold, though, and has an indifferent relationship with all of his children, especially Tyrion, whom he sees as an embarrassment. However, it is remarked by his own sister Genna that he shares most of his similarities (his cleverness, his ruthlessness, his independent power) with Tyrion, though when confronted with this Tywin was furious and refused to speak to her again.\n</p>\n<p>Tywin is remarked to be so proud of his family name that he will do absolutely anything politically to improve his legacy, which he is practically obsessed with. Humourless and implacable, Tywin never laughs and mistrusts laughter, having suffered japes and jokes his entire life because of Aerys Targaryen\'s envy, and Tytos Lannister\'s stupidity. It is remarked that he had an incredibly close friendship with Aerys when they were boys, but as it became clear that Tywin was better at ruling than Aerys could ever be, that relationship was soured and eventually destroyed by insult upon insult on Aerys\' part. He loved his wife Joanna, and when she died he became cruel and pitiless to anyone who crossed him - even in comparison to how he was before.\n</p>\n<p>Having served as Hand to the Mad King, Tywin is almost undisputed in his efficiency in that position. A brilliant administrator, he devotes himself completely to a task at hand, so much that little else will matter to him. Tywin is not affectionate, and almost never has been, and will never shy from giving his opinion, even if it means facing off against the king he is serving.\n</p>\n<p>Tywin was the eldest son of Lord <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Tytos_Lannister\" title=\"Tytos Lannister\">Tytos Lannister</a> and Lady Jeyne Marbrand. After openly speaking out against the marriage between his sister Genna and House Frey, his father sent him to court, where he met Prince <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Aerys_II_Targaryen\" title=\"Aerys II Targaryen\">Aerys Targaryen</a> and Steffon Baratheon. During the War of the Ninepenny Kings, Tywin became a knight, and earned the honour of knighting the young prince. However, throughout Tywin\'s youth, he was plagued by the terrible reputation of his house and, especially, his father. Tytos Lannister was the laughingstock of the Westerlands, which Tywin was made painfully clear of during the campaigns in the Stepstones.\n</p>\n<p>While still in his teens, Tywin declared the debts to House Lannister to be repaid; he imprisoned Lord Tarbeck when the latter went to treat with his father. However, Lord Tytos overruled Tywin and released Tarbeck with an apology. Enraged, incredulous and utterly fuming, Tywin waited a year before reigniting his campaign. Houses Tarbeck and Reyne rebelled against House Lannister, and Tywin rode out <i>en force</i> and destroyed both the houses, their homes and all of their descendants. This act would be depicted in the song \"<a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/The_Rains_of_Castamere\" title=\"The Rains of Castamere\">The Rains of Castamere</a>\", one of the most famous songs in Westeros. Tywin was named Hand of the King by the newly-crowned Aerys Targaryen. Tywin wed his own cousin, <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Joanna_Lannister\" title=\"Joanna Lannister\">Lady Joanna</a>.\n</p>\n<p>He became Warden of the West and Lord of <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Casterly_Rock\" title=\"Casterly Rock\">Casterly Rock</a> upon his father\'s death. Lord Tywin was by all accounts an able Hand, credited by many with giving the Seven Kingdoms twenty years of peace and prosperity, though it caused tension between Tywin and an increasingly-paranoid <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Aerys_II_Targaryen\" title=\"Aerys II Targaryen\">King Aerys II</a>. The relationship between the two slowly and violently collapsed when it became clear that Tywin was the man who truly ruled the realm, Aerys lusted after Tywin\'s cousin Joanna, and apparently took liberties during the wedding night, and Aerys refused a marriage proposal between his son Rhaegar and Tywin\'s daughter Cersei.\n</p>\n<p>Tywin\'s wife Joanna died in childbirth while bringing their youngest son Tyrion into the world. After Joanna died, Tywin apparently never smiled again, and never ceased to hold Tyrion in contempt. Furthermore, Tyrion being a dwarf was a truly humiliating fact and running joke throughout Westeros for Tywin, and even Aerys tormented Tywin with the idea that Tywin had been cursed with a dead wife and a deformed son to teach him some humility. Tyrion would grow to hate his father, even though some people realise that the two of them are intensely similar.\n</p>\n<p>After the investiture of his eldest son and heir, <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Jaime_Lannister\" title=\"Jaime Lannister\">Ser Jaime</a>, into the <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Kingsguard\" title=\"Kingsguard\">Kingsguard</a>, Tywin resigned the Handship and returned to Casterly Rock.

After the <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Battle_of_the_Trident\" title=\"Battle of the Trident\">Battle of the Trident</a>, he led a force of roughly 12,000 men to King\'s Landing, declaring his loyalty to Aerys II. Once the king opened the gates, however, Lord Tywin\'s forces proceeded to sack the city.

Victarion is an extremely proud ironborn warrior, fierce and implacable in battle and utterly fearless to his enemies. At one point, he actually caught an incoming sword with one hand in order to defend himself.\n</p>\n<p>However, in spite of his great prowess and respect as a warrior, Victarion is easily recognised as not particularly smart, nor possessing of great wisdom or common sense. He believes that he is improving people\'s lives simply by making them ironborn thralls, and is rather gullible. He also struggles to blame himself for something, as he beat his wife to death for being raped by Euron, but believes that the Crow\'s Eye is the man who killed her when he raped her.\n</p>\n<p>Recognizing the greatness of his older brother Balon, Victarion chose to follow him faithfully. Commanding the Iron Fleet during the <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Greyjoy_Rebellion\" title=\"Greyjoy Rebellion\">Greyjoy Rebellion</a>, and using a battle plan his brother Euron conceived, he maneuvered his fleet into enemy territory and destroyed the Lannister fleet by burning their ships down at anchor.

Victarion is a strong candidate, and makes a good case at the Kingsmoot, but his brother Euron sways the crowds, promising to conquer the entirety of Westeros with dragons, and is chosen as the new king. Despite his vast hatred for Euron, Victarion\'s obedience and dutifulness runs deep, and he continues to serve Euron faithfully. He leads an assault on the Shield Islands, killing all foes but taking a wound to his hand in the process. After the battle is over, Euron steals away many of Victarion\'s and his other rivals\' most trusted confidants and supporters by giving them titles on the Shield Islands.\n</p>\n<p>Euron tasks Victarion with taking the Iron Fleet to <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Slaver%27s_Bay\" title=\"Slaver\'s Bay\">Slaver\'s Bay</a> in order to retrieve <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Daenerys_Targaryen\" title=\"Daenerys Targaryen\">Daenerys Targaryen</a>, whom Euron means to wed, and her dragons.

Victarion thinks to himself that Euron\'s gifts are poisoned, and suspects Kerwin of poisoning him, as his wounded hand has become infected.\n</p>\n<p>On the journey, nearly half of the Iron Fleet is lost during storms, leaving Victarion to capture passing trading vessels to increase his numbers.

Visenya than married her brother <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Aegon_I_Targaryen\" title=\"Aegon I Targaryen\">Aegon I Targaryen</a>, along with her younger sister <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Rhaenys_Targaryen\" title=\"Rhaenys Targaryen\">Rhaenys Targaryen</a>. The three Targaryens ruled with great wisdom and peace, Visenya later gave birth to her only son Maegor the Cruel.\n</p>\n<p>After her brother\'s death and ascension of her nephew Aenys, Visenya seemed to prefer to dwell at Dragonstone alongside Vhagar. The actions of the Faith Militant against the crown angered her and urged her nephew to take decisive action, something Aenys seemed reluctant to do. When Aenys died of a sudden illness (although many believe she poisoned him), she flew to Pentos and brought her son Maegor from exile. When Maegor took the throne, he put Queen Dowager Alyssa and her children Jaehaerys and Alysanne under her custody at Dragonstone while he warred against the Faith. She passed away in 44AC, this allowed Alyssa and her children to leave Dragonstone.\n</p>\n<p>After Aegon\'s death, Visenya\'s son <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Maegor_I_Targaryen\" title=\"Maegor I Targaryen\">Maegor I Targaryen</a> and nephew <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Aenys_I_Targaryen\" title=\"Aenys I Targaryen\">Aenys I Targaryen</a> ruled Westeros somewhat together. Maegor was considered to be too violent and cruel. Her nephew Aenys was too weak and left the duty of running the military to his half-brother while he was tasked with the everyday runnings of the kingdom. This was widely accepted because of the cruel nature of Maegor. Visenya\'s line, unlike her sister Rhaenys\' ended with the death of her only son Maegor, who was presumably murdered while on the Iron Throne.\n</p>\n<p>Visenya shared the same traditional Valyrian looks as her sister and brother. Her silver-gold hair was braided and bound in rings, she also had the unique lilac eyes of the Targaryens. She dressed in a warrior-like attire and carried the Valyrian sword <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Dark_Sister\" title=\"Dark Sister\">Dark Sister</a>. She was stern, sensual, and passionate. She was also more of a temptress with a dark, unforgiving side to her. Visenya and her sister would often compete for Aegon\'s attention, but each in their own way. Visenya was well known for being the polar opposite of Rhaenys: It cannot be a coincidence that she owned a sword called <i>Dark Sister.</i>\n</p>\n<p>Visenya was extremely blunt: when they were attacked in the streets, Visenya berated Aegon for his ineffectual guards, before going so far as to <i>scar his cheek with her sword</i> to prove her point. This led to the creation of the Kingsguard. She went on to advocate the laws and vows of the Kingsguard, desiring them to be the greatest, most loyal and efficient knights in all the realm.\n</p>\n<p>Especially later in her life, Visenya proved to be uncompromising, cruel and unapologetic about her opinions - she remained completely critical of King Aenys\' actions during his time as king, believing him to be weak despite having loved his mother. She openly defied Aenys by officiating the unlawful marriage between her son and Alys Harroway. She advocated violence throughout the reign of Aenys and later Maegor, who proved to be far more dangerous than her.\n</p>','http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Visenya_Targaryen',NULL,153,34),(946,'Viserra Targaryen',0,0,NULL,'<p>Princess <b>Viserra Targaryen</b> was the tenth born child of King Jaehaerys I Targaryen and Queen Alysanne Targaryen.\n</p>','http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Viserra_Targaryen',NULL,NULL,NULL),(947,'Viserys II Targaryen',1,0,NULL,'<p>King <b>Viserys II Targaryen</b> was the tenth king of the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Targaryen\" title=\"Targaryen\">Targaryen</a> dynasty to sit on the <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Iron_Throne\" title=\"Iron Throne\">Iron Throne</a> of <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Westeros\" title=\"Westeros\">Westeros</a>.\n</p>\n<p>Viserys was the younger son of <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Rhaenyra_Targaryen\" title=\"Rhaenyra Targaryen\">Rhaenyra Targaryen</a>, the grandson of King <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Viserys_I\" title=\"Viserys I\">Viserys I</a>, the younger brother of <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Aegon_III\" title=\"Aegon III\">Aegon III</a> and the uncle of <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Daeron_I\" title=\"Daeron I\">Daeron I</a> and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Baelor_I\" title=\"Baelor I\">Baelor I</a>.

Baelor kept him in the position when he succeeded Daeron, and Viserys spent a lot of time suppressing his pious but politically naive nephew\'s more outlandish notions. He succeeded and his nephew died as one of the most popular kings in the history of Westeros.\n</p>\n<p>With the deaths of both Daeron and Baelor without issue, Viserys finally took the throne as Viserys II. His reign was short, only one year, before succumbing to age. In that year he ruled well and released his nieces from the <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Maidenvault\" title=\"Maidenvault\">Maidenvault</a> where Baelor had secured them, but there was a scurrulous rumour that he had arranged Baelor\'s death out of Baelor\'s incompetence at being the king.

He was also considered more charming than Aegon, but became stern as he grew older.\n</p>\n<p>Viserys II reigned for a year but, as Hand, effectively ruled for fifteen. In this role he was a skilled negotiator and diplomat, as well as an able treasurer and administrator. He kept the realm ticking over whilst Daeron warred and Baelor prayed. He appears to have been strong and reliable, but the rumours over Baelor\'s death continued to besmirch his reputation long after his death.\n</p>\n<p>Viserys was in his late fifties when he took the throne. He was strong and clean-shaven, but with a prominent nose, bushy eyebrows and a somewhat calculating look to his face. He was not a warrior and was usually found consulting with the <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Small_council\" title=\"Small council\">small council</a>. He wore his brother Aegon III\'s simple crown.\n</p>\n<p>Some early American editions of <i><a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/A_Game_of_Thrones\" title=\"A Game of Thrones\">A Game of Thrones</a></i> and most of the British ones list Viserys II as the fourth son of Aegon III Targaryen.

He was gaunt, hard and thin from being on the run almost all of his life. He was not as tall as Rhaegar Targaryen, who was considered a greater man than him.\n</p>\n<p>Viserys was extremely impatient and hot-tempered, prone to outbursts of anger he somewhat over-dramatically referred to as \'waking the <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Dragon\" title=\"Dragon\">dragon</a>\' - this was a stellar display of how he possibly exhibited the madness inherent in some Targaryens, even though Viserys was younger than most of the previous examples. He could occasionally be charming or friendly, but most of the time he expected obedience and respect simply due to his title, unaware that people called him the \'Beggar King\' behind his back and that, without a kingdom, crown or victory to his name, he was no true king. Perhaps what some people recognised was that he was, in some ways, worse than his father, since he flouted the traditions of his family and openly derided the traditions of other cultures, such as the Dothraki.\n</p>\n<p>Due to a lack of funds, he had no crown and dressed modestly, sometimes haggardly when resources were especially low. He was frequently unkind to Daenerys, who feared him most of her childhood. She believes he blames her for their mother\'s death. Viserys talks of how he will defeat his enemies in battle, but he has never seriously trained in arms nor lead soldiers, therefore he was a poor commander and a poorer warrior, and not especially charismatic - even Aerys was charismatic in his own way at Viserys\' age, if utterly ostentatious. He has always looked at Daenerys as his property, he tried to sneak into her bedroom the night before her marriage to deny Drogo her virginity, but Illyrio had posted guards who stopped him.\n</p>\n<p>Viserys was a man with more fire than sense, and wasn\'t very intelligent - he was ignorant of many things that would be powerful objects to his triumph or disgrace, and did not realise when he had made plainly disastrous mistakes. When Daenerys remembers him, she laments for the boy he was and the man he became, but acknowledges that he was a dangerous and cruel man who would have been a terrible king, even though he believed himself to be \'the dragon\'.\n</p>\n<p>In almost every way conceivable, Viserys is actually the opposite of his brother Rhaegar - he cares nothing for honour, tradition or decency, and is self-obsessed to the point of absurdity; he is not a good fighter and is cruel to anyone who crosses him (allegedly or actually). He also died differently to Rhaegar, in dishonour and disgrace, whereas Rhaegar died in a fierce and now-legendary duel with his mortal enemy.\n</p>\n<p>Viserys was born in 276 AL. He is the second son and the middle child of Aerys II. He is the younger brother of Rhaegar and the older brother of Daenerys.

They lost the house they had been staying in and had to resume a life of wandering.\n</p>\n<p>They were given a new home by Magister <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Ilyrio_Mopatis\" title=\"Ilyrio Mopatis\">Ilyrio Mopatis</a> of <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Pentos\" title=\"Pentos\">Pentos</a>. Ilyrio was a canny politican and merchant, and suggested an audacious plan to Viserys: they could marry Daenerys to the leader of a <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Dothraki\" title=\"Dothraki\">Dothraki</a> <a href=\"http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Khalasar\" title=\"Khalasar\">khalasar</a>, who was looking for a wife of royal blood. The Dothraki were always looking for lands to plunder, and if they could overcome their traditional fear of ships for the short crossing to Westeros, they would relish the chance to plunder the Seven Kingdoms. Viserys could reclaim his throne at the same time. Viserys readily agreed and the marriage was carried out.\n</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, Viserys soon found that his status counted for less than nothing among the Dothraki, and his constant demands and entreaties that they set sail for Westeros immediately fell on deaf ears. Khal Drogo insisted on going to Vaes Dothrak first to let the Dosh Khalleen give prophesies about his marriage, and then he would wait for the birth of his heir. Magister Illyrio had told Viserys to wait in his manse in Pentos, but, Viserys had refused and insisted on staying with the khalasar until Drogo fulfilled his promises. Eventually, Viserys loses patience and threatens Daenerys\' life.

Tyrion is wary of Theon given what he saw of him at Winterfell and his crimes against the Starks; however, Theon and Yara insist that he has paid for what he has done. In the end, Daenerys, Tyrion, Yara, and Theon find common ground in their hatred of their <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Aerys_II_Targaryen\" title=\"Aerys II Targaryen\">cruel</a> and <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Tywin_Lannister\" title=\"Tywin Lannister\">merciless</a> <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Balon_Greyjoy\" title=\"Balon Greyjoy\">fathers</a> and their desire for a better world. Yara manages to convince Daenerys not to trust Euron, with Theon pointing out that if Euron has no qualms about killing his own family, he\'d have no problem with killing Daenerys after marrying her to gain control of all of Westeros. Daenerys finds Yara\'s terms reasonable (particularly since Yara\'s offer of alliance is far less matrimonial), and accepts the aid of her one hundred ships, although with the condition that the <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Ironborn\" title=\"Ironborn\">Ironborn</a> stop their raping and piracy of the mainland, which Yara reluctantly accepts. <sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-13\"><a href=\"#cite_note-13\">[14]</a></sup>\n</p>\n<p>Some time later, Yara and Theon begin the voyage back to <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Westeros\" title=\"Westeros\">Westeros</a>, with the <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Iron_Fleet\" title=\"Iron Fleet\">Iron Fleet</a> forming part of Daenerys Targaryen\'s massive invasion force. <sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-14\"><a href=\"#cite_note-14\">[15]</a></sup>\n</p>\n<p>As Euron lowers his plank onto the <i>Black Wind</i>, the invasion begins.

Despite her skillful style of attack, Euron overpowers his niece and holds his axe to her throat. Calling over to Theon, whom he calls a \"cockless coward\", Euron challenges his nephew to try and save Yara. However, Theon looks around and gets a harsh reminder of his torture by Ramsay Bolton as he sees Euron\'s men cutting out the tongues of his defeated comrades. Realizing he may suffer the same with Euron and still mentally unstable from his past, Yara is abandoned by Theon after he jumps off the <i>Black Wind</i>. With Euron laughing in her face and having lost all respect for Theon, Yara is taken below decks by Euron, as they sail away, en route to King\'s Landing, on the <i>Silence</i>.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-15\"><a href=\"#cite_note-15\">[16]</a></sup>\n</p>\n<p>Following Euron\'s <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Assault_on_the_Targaryen_Fleet\" title=\"Assault on the Targaryen Fleet\">assault on the Targaryen fleet</a>, Yara along with Ellaria and Tyene are led in chains through the streets of King\'s Landing by her triumphant uncle. Yara and the Dornish women are pelted with rotten fruits by the smallfolk. Euron mockingly tells his niece that they are receiving a hero\'s welcome. Yara and her fellow captives are brought before Queen Cersei, who appoints Euron as the commander of her naval forces.

Afterwards, Theon convinces the remaining Ironborn loyal to Yara to mount a rescue mission, just as Yara did to save him.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-18\"><a href=\"#cite_note-18\">[19]</a></sup>\n</p>\n<p>Yara Greyjoy is an Ironborn woman of the finest caliber: courageous, clever, determined and proud. In sharp contrast to the allusions people have about her on the basis that she is a woman, Yara is extremely headstrong and formidable towards anybody who dares cross her, as well as possessing a sharp, cynical, and sarcastic sense of humor. She rebuffs Theon\'s labeling her as a woman by pointing out that he is the one wearing a skirt, knowing full well that he has already been berated for it and it will only enrage him. She is a fierce warrior and a staunch leader, and obdurate about her own independence. She does not apologize to her father for leading a personal mission to rescue Theon from the Boltons, despite having failed and lost many men. Later on, when Theon returns, Yara is furious with him for costing her so many lives in his decision to stay in the Dreadfort, showing that she was remorseful of her defeat during the rescue mission.\n</p>\n<p>Because of her sharpness, Yara can come across as aggressive towards people she doesn\'t like or people who try to put her in her place, and isn\'t swayed when Theon warns her against crossing him. She can be slightly judgmental and labels Theon as an idiot for forgetting that, while he <i>had</i> conquered Winterfell, the Ironborn were primarily sailors and islanders and couldn\'t hold landlocked castles like Winterfell for very long. Nevertheless, she clearly loves Theon enough to want to rescue him from Ramsay Bolton, and previously she begged him not to die \'so far from the sea\', gently recalling the two of them as children. By the time Theon returns to the Iron Islands after Eddard Stark\'s death, Yara is a renowned leader and, in Balon\'s words, has commanded and killed men with her own hands. She eventually gained great support during the Kingsmoot with the reminder that she was a reaver, a warrior and a seasoned leader, but this was ruined when Euron arrived and promised the present ironborn greater glory.\n</p>\n<p>Despite their troubled past, different personalities and Theon\'s actions, Yara still values Theon\'s advice, possibly from his experiences in the North and Riverlands, shown when she only agrees to Daenerys Targaryen\'s conditions when Theon nods his approval, and continues to be protective of him, telling Ellaria Sand to leave him alone when she asks him to pour ale for her and then invites him for a threesome with Yara (though it can be argued that Ellaria did not know that Theon had been castrated by Ramsay). Yara was also apologetic of mocking Theon at the brothel in Volantis, compensating for her coldness by encouraging him to continue living and fighting, because she needed him beside her in order to defeat Euron and avenge their father; in this particular conversation, she showed her more compassionate side and shed the scornful way in which she spoke to Theon when he first returned to the Iron Islands.\n</p>\n<p>In the <i><a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/A_Song_of_Ice_and_Fire\" title=\"A Song of Ice and Fire\">A Song of Ice and Fire</a></i> novels Yara is called <b>Asha Greyjoy</b>, but her name was changed in the TV series; possibly to prevent confusion with <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Osha\" title=\"Osha\">Osha</a> the wildling. Ironically, as the daughter of a Great House and one of Balon Greyjoy\'s only two surviving children, Asha Greyjoy is actually a much more prominent character than Osha the wildling; Asha is even a POV character in several chapters. Thus it is curious why they changed Asha\'s name and not the other way around. It is probably because Osha was already introduced in Season 1 and the similarity with Asha Greyjoy\'s name wasn\'t realized until production on Season 2 began.\n</p>\n<p>In the German dub of the TV series, however, the character is still called \"Asha\" as in the books.\n</p>\n<p>Another small change is that in the books, \"Asha Greyjoy\" has short black hair, a lean build, and a sharp beak of a nose. In the TV series, \"Yara Greyjoy\" has brown hair. Other than these minor naming and cosmetic differences, Gemma Whelan\'s portrayal is actually quite faithful to Asha Greyjoy\'s behavior and actions in the books.\n</p>\n<p>According to Dagmer, after Balon lost his three sons, Asha was his solace. He has learned to rely on her, and she has never failed him.\n</p>\n<p>Balon is greatly proud of his wild headstrong daughter, and believes she can succeed him, although it is doubtful the other Ironborn would accept her as their queen. He wishes Theon dead so he would not stand in Asha\'s way, though this resentment has been cut from the television series, where Balon appears to be genuinely saddened after \"losing\" Theon to the Starks.\n</p>\n<p>Asha\'s uncles Victarion Greyjoy, <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Aeron_Greyjoy\" title=\"Aeron Greyjoy\">Aeron Greyjoy</a>, and Rodrik \"the Reader\" Harlaw respect her and acknowledge her power, but do not believe she can rule the Ironborn due to her gender. Other Ironborn often mock Asha ribaldy. However, Asha is confident and strong-willed enough to dismiss such attitude scornfully, and she always talks back sharply and makes fun of those who taunt her.\n</p>\n<p>Asha\'s crew adore her devotedly. Half of them love her as their daughter, the other half want to have sex with her, and all of them would die for her.\n</p>\n<p>Some time after Winterfell was sacked, Asha comes there, but finds only unrecognizable dead bodies, partly eaten by wolves. She believes Theon is dead, but admits she cannot be certain. She, not Balon, receives a taunting letter from Ramsay with a piece of Theon\'s skin. That makes her realize what has become of her brother, but unlike in the show she never attempts to save him from the Dreadfort.\n</p>\n<p>Asha loves her father, but considers him as \"a brave man but a bad lord\". She realizes, at far earlier point than in the show (while the ironborn still hold Moat Cailin and Deepwood Motte), that the Ironborn have gained nothing from his military campaigns - the Greyjoy Rebellion and the invasion to the North - only casualties.\n</p>\n<p>Asha is far more intelligent and progressive than most of the ironborn (who cannot even read and think only about plundering and reaving). She believes it would be best for the Ironborn to make peace with the North, and this is her main platform at the <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Kingsmoot\" title=\"Kingsmoot\">kingsmoot</a>.\n</p>\n<p>Asha becomes a POV narrator starting in the fourth novel, <i>A Feast for Crows</i>. This storyline was pushed back so it corresponds to TV-Yara starting in Season 6. Season Six incorporates the Asha storyline from the novel but changes some of the order of events. In <i>A Feast of Crows</i>, Balon is dead by the time that Yara returns to the Iron Islands. Instead of visiting Pyke, she visits her uncle Rodrik Harlaw in the Ten Towers. Despite these differences, the TV series still incorporates Asha\'s character, including her intention to succeed her father as ruler of the Iron Islands and her criticism of Balon\'s war strategy in the North. The death of Balon is first reported as an \"off-screen\" event in <i>A Storm of Swords</i> and Asha is not present at his funeral.\n</p>\n<p>Asha\'s reunion with Theon occurs under very different circumstances in the fifth novel, <i>A Dance of Dragons</i>. Asha, who by this stage has been taken prisoner by King Stannis Baratheon, encounters a disheveled and battered Theon, who had recently assisted to rescue \"Arya Stark\" (actually <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Jeyne_Poole\" title=\"Jeyne Poole\">Jeyne Poole</a>) from Ramsay Bolton. By that stage, the Kingsmoot has already occurred with Asha and her followers fleeing back to Deepwood Motte in the wake of Euron\'s victory. In the novels, Asha initially does not recognize Theon - in her eyes he is an old man, resembling a scarecrow, his face is a skull with skin, his hair bone-white and filthy; a reversal of their first reunion on Pyke in <i>A Clash of Kings</i>. When Stannis intends to execute Theon for his role in the alleged murders of Bran and Rickon, she pleads for his life. When that fails, she petitions Stannis to execute him with the sword to spare him a painful death by burning.\n</p>\n<p>While the <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Kingsmoot\" title=\"Kingsmoot\">Kingsmoot</a> in <i>A Feast of Crows</i> also results in Euron\'s victory, it takes place under different circumstances from the TV series. Firstly, the Kingsmoot takes place on Old Wyk rather than Pyke. Instead of a two horse race between Yara and Euron, her book counterpart Asha has to face several candidates including her other uncle Victarion Greyjoy. Asha manages to humiliate one of her opponents, Erik Ironmaker, by daring him to stand on his two feet (which, being elderly and overweight, he is unable to do). Erik\'s support evaporates when he is unable to rise. Unlike the TV series, Asha campaigns on a peace platform castigating Balon\'s war and advocating making peace with the North in return for some lands. In the novel, the Kingsmoot almost ends in a fight between Asha and Victarion\'s supporters until Euron manages to win the Ironborn over by having one of man blow an enchanted horn, the Dragonbinder, explaining of his plan to find and wed Daenerys, use the horn to control her dragons and have the ironborn conquer Westeros. Following Euron\'s victory, Asha and her supporters travel overland through Great Wyk before sailing back to Deepwood Motte. Euron doesn\'t openly say that he wants to kill Theon and Asha, as he did in the TV series: everyone thinks Theon is dead at the time, and he thinks of a more politically correct tactic to sideline her. Euron cleverly marries Asha in absentia to the elderly Erik Ironmaker, one of the other lords at the Kingsmoot, so if she returns to the isles she can be taken prisoner and removed as a threat.\n</p>\n<p>At Deepwood Motte, Asha considers her options: go to Torrhen\'s Square, which is still held by Dagmer; make new life as a trader across the Narrow Sea; settle at Sea Dragon Point; return to the Iron Islands and try to raise the Ironborn against their new-crowned king. She soon receives a taunting letter from Ramsay Bolton revealing that Theon is actually still alive and being tortured in his dungeon; she feels sorry for her brother, but does not intend to rescue him. On learning of this, Tristifer Botley (who wishes to marry Asha) explains to her the history of Torgon the Latecomer: that a <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Kingsmoot\" title=\"Kingsmoot\">Kingsmoot</a> can be declared invalid by the priests if one of the prior king\'s lawful sons was not present to put forward his candidacy. The story gives Asha an idea: Theon probably wouldn\'t win an election even if they manage to rescue him, but Asha realizes that his mere survival would give a pretext for the Drowned Men to invalidate Euron\'s election and call for a new Kingsmoot. Given that the Drowned Men hate Euron as an \"ungodly\" man they would probably agree to this, and several of the major lords who voted for Euron are starting to grow uneasy at his dark behavior, there\'s a good chance Asha could hold and win a new Kingsmoot if she manages to recover Theon.\n</p>\n<p>Before Asha can start acting on this nascent plan, however, <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Stannis_Baratheon\" title=\"Stannis Baratheon\">Stannis Baratheon</a> attacks, in the <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Second_Battle_of_Deepwood_Motte\" title=\"Second Battle of Deepwood Motte\">Second Battle of Deepwood Motte</a>. Nearly all Asha\'s remaining forces are slaughtered, and she herself is taken prisoner. The march of Stannis\'s host to Winterfell is narrated from her POV.\n</p>\n<p>After travelling more than a month in Stannis\'s camp, Asha is reunited with none other than Theon, who was captured/rescued by loyalist Northern forces, led by Mors Umber, outside of <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Winterfell\" title=\"Winterfell\">Winterfell</a> (after jumping off the castle walls along with <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Jeyne_Poole\" title=\"Jeyne Poole\">Jeyne Poole</a> under cover from a blizzard). Theon\'s torture at Ramsay\'s hands has been so severe that he is unrecognizable to her at first, looking like a starved toothless old man and with his hair having turned white from the stress.\n</p>\n<p>In the sample chapter of the sixth book, Theon overhears Ser Justin Massey requesting permission from Stannis to marry Asha, reasoning that one day Stannis will need to take the Iron Islands, and that will go much easier with Balon Greyjoy\'s daughter as a catspaw, with one of his own leal men as her lord husband. Ser Justin claims the fact that Asha is currently married is not a problem: her marriage was done with a proxy, and was never consummated, and therefore can be annulled; besides, Erik Ironmaker has one foot in the grave. Stannis thinks it over and answers \"Serve me well in this matter of the sellswords, and you may have what you desire. Until such time, the woman must needs remain my captive\".\n</p>\n<p>Asha and Theon do not flee with the <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Iron_Fleet\" title=\"Iron Fleet\">Iron Fleet</a> to <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Meereen\" title=\"Meereen\">Meereen</a> in the current novels - the TV show gave them this subplot as a condensation with the storyline of their other uncle, Victarion, who was cut from the TV series. Euron actually sends Victarion with the Iron Fleet to Meereen to court Daenerys as Euron\'s new bride, but Victarion secretly plans to betray his hated brother and marry Daenerys himself, then use the Iron Fleet and her dragons to retake the isles. The TV version condensed this so that Yara and Theon flee with the Iron Fleet to seek Daenerys\'s help, but <i>openly</i> plan to return to overthrow Euron.\n</p>\n<p>It is as-yet unknown if Asha and Theon in the books might also try to ally with Daenerys in the next novel - this is assuming they somehow manage to escape both Stannis\'s camp and the Bolton army. There <i>might</i> also be a second Kingsmoot in the novels, to which Asha hopes to bring Theon to endorse her candidacy - if so, the TV show condensed this into a single event.\n</p>\n<p>In \"<a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/The_Broken_Man\" title=\"The Broken Man\">The Broken Man</a>\", Yara Greyjoy and her <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Ironborn\" title=\"Ironborn\">Ironborn</a> followers are at a <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Volantis\" title=\"Volantis\">Volantis</a> brothel.

Yara tells <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Theon_Greyjoy\" title=\"Theon Greyjoy\">Theon Greyjoy</a> that, \"Now, since it\'s my last night ashore for a long while, I\'m gonna go fuck the tits off <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Volantene_whore_1_(The_Broken_Man)\" title=\"Volantene whore 1 (The Broken Man)\">this one</a>.\" This implies Yara doesn\'t have sex with her crew, but waits after long voyages at sea.\n</p>\n<p>In the \"<a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Battle_of_the_Bastards_(episode)\" title=\"Battle of the Bastards (episode)\">Battle of the Bastards</a>\", Yara states she\'s \"up for anything\" in response to <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Daenerys_Targaryen\" title=\"Daenerys Targaryen\">Daenerys Targaryen</a> asking if her alliance had a marriage proposal.\n</p>\n<p>In \"<a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Stormborn\" title=\"Stormborn\">Stormborn</a>\", on the <i>Black Wind</i>, <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Ellaria_Sand\" title=\"Ellaria Sand\">Ellaria Sand</a>, while drinking Ironborn liquor with Yara and Theon, Ellaria asks Yara if she had ever been to Dorne, to which Yara responds that she has been there a few times. Ellaria responds that there is a boy in every port in Dorne, which Yara responds, \"A boy, a girl. Depends on the port.\" This implies, but doesn\'t confirm, Yara has had sex with men and women. Yara and Ellaria begin to sexually flirt with each other. Ellaria invites Theon to have a threesome with her and Yara, but Yara tells Ellaria to \"Leave him be.\" Yara and Ellaria began kissing, the <i>Black Wind</i> is struck.\n</p>\n<p>Yara is a follower of the <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Drowned_God\" title=\"Drowned God\">Drowned God</a>. <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Gender_and_Sexuality\" title=\"Gender and Sexuality\">Attitudes towards male or female homosexuality</a> in the Drowned God religion hasn\'t actually been mentioned in the books or the show.\n</p>\n<p>In a post-Season 6 interviews with the, actress <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Gemma_Whelan\" title=\"Gemma Whelan\">Gemma Whelan</a> shared how she thought Yara Greyjoy in the TV series is \"pansexual\" (the term she uses), attracted to both men and women. Explicitly asked in an interview with <i>Vulture</i> if Yara is \"lesbian\" or \"bisexual\", she said she thought Yara had sex with both men and women, and that the term \"pansexual\" would probably be more accurate, not \"bisexual\".<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-21\"><a href=\"#cite_note-21\">[22]</a></sup><sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-22\"><a href=\"#cite_note-22\">[23]</a></sup>\n</p>\n<p><i>Game of Thrones Wiki</i> reached out to <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/George_R.R._Martin\" title=\"George R.R. Martin\">George R.R. Martin</a> himself to inquire about this, and he responded:\n</p>\n<p>Martin therefore confirmed that Asha in the books <i>is not</i> bisexual, and if this is the case it is an invention of the TV series for Yara to be attracted to women.\n</p>\n<p>Reaction to this change in Asha/Yara\'s sexuality generally received a positive reception from critics. <i>WatchersOnTheWall.com</i>\'s Sue the Fury said \"I\"m stoked for the show to have Yara be interested in women. It\'s not important to the plot but I appreciate it.\"<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-24\"><a href=\"#cite_note-24\">[25]</a></sup> <i>AfterEllen.com</i>\'s Chelsea Steiner wrote a separate op/ed article on the development, and said she was happy that TV-Yara is presented as a queer female in the TV show that is a \"woman of agency\" and major protagonist in Season 6, instead of just one of the background prostitutes having sex with other women as in past seasons.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-25\"><a href=\"#cite_note-25\">[26]</a></sup>\n</p>\n<p>Yara is actually not the first queer female character to appear in the TV series, even discounting minor female prostitutes who appear in the background of scenes (or put on performances for men, as Ros and Daisy did in Season 1). The first queer female character to be introduced in the TV series was <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Ellaria_Sand\" title=\"Ellaria Sand\">Ellaria Sand</a>, whose first scenes in Season 4 involved her picking out a female prostitute to have sex with (along with her male lover Oberyn, who was also bisexual); several episodes later Ellaria was shown on-screen receiving oral sex from the female prostitute <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Marei\" title=\"Marei\">Marei</a>. Ellaria and Oberyn were described as bisexual/pan-sexual in the novels, though the books didn\'t outright depict them in sex scenes.\n</p>\n<p>Asha Greyjoy in the books shows no particular hints of being interested in women: she <i>is</i> very sexually active and unashamed of this, going so far as to learn from a <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Woods_witch\" title=\"Woods witch\">woods witch</a> how to make her own moon tea (a contraceptive and abortive drug). She has had numerous relationships, long and short, over the course of her adult life. This is considered very atypical behavior for a highborn woman, much less an Ironborn woman, but Balon raised her as essentially a surrogate son, so she doesn\'t strive towards lady-like behavior. In the books, she even cuts her hair short like a boy\'s (though artistic depictions of what exactly \"short\" means can vary, and might mean nearly shoulder length, given that men in the medieval setting also wear their hair fairly long). When Theon first encounters Asha again in the second novel, he notes that only a few Ironborn women ever take part in sailing on their longships, but it is said of those who do that the salt and sea change them, giving them \"a man\'s appetites\" - however, in this context Theon\'s POV narration specifically referred to how sexually forward she was being with <i>him</i>, a man (as part of her prank not telling him she was his sister that he hadn\'t seen in 10 years).\n</p>\n<p>Asha has been very sexually active with men and had many lovers: some for half a year, many for just half a night. One of the more notable ones is her love-sick champion Tristifer Botley whom she broke up with as a teenager but who nonetheless remains loyal to Asha and continues to pine for her. She later lost her virtue when she was 16 years old to a sailor from <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Lys\" title=\"Lys\">Lys</a>.
